The character, played by Robert Downey Jr., debuted in 2008’s Iron Man and appeared in ten MCU films, including three solo movies and four Avengers movies. However, his story came to an end in 2019’s Avengers: Endgame, where he sacrificed himself to defeat Thanos and save the universe.</p><p>Since then, many fans have been wondering if there will be another Iron Man movie, or if the character will return in some form. Although Marvel Studios has not officially confirmed or denied the possibility of Iron Man 4, there have been some rumors and speculations about the project. Here is everything we know so far about Iron Man 4 release date, full movie, trailer, cast, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Is-Iron-Man-4-Happening.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Iron_Man_4_Happening></span>Is Iron Man 4 Happening?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The short answer is: that we don’t know for sure. Marvel Studios has not announced any plans for Iron Man 4 as of October 8, 2023. However, that does not mean that the project is completely off the table.&nbsp;Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has said that he never says never to anything in the MCU and that there are always surprises and secrets in store for the fans.</p><p>Robert Downey Jr., on the other hand, has indicated that he is done playing Tony Stark after his emotional exit in Endgame.&nbsp;He said that he had an incredible run with the character and that he wanted to leave on a high note.&nbsp;He also said that he respects Marvel’s decision to move on with new stories and characters. However, he did not rule out the possibility of returning to the MCU in some capacity, saying that anything could happen.</p><p>There are also some hints that Iron Man 4 could be in the works for future phases of the MCU. For instance, Marvel Studios has announced several Iron Man-related projects for Disney Plus, such as Armor Wars and Ironheart. These shows could introduce new characters who could take on the mantle of Iron Man or become his successors. Moreover, Marvel Studios has acquired the rights to use characters from Sony’s Spider-Man universe, such as Venom and Morbius. These characters have connections to Iron Man in the comics and could potentially cross over with him in future films.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/What-Can-Fans-Expect-from-Iron-Man-4.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Can_Fans_Expect_from_Iron_Man_4></span>What Can Fans Expect from Iron Man 4?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron Man</a> 4 does happen, there are several possibilities for what it could be about. One option is to continue Tony Stark’s story from a different perspective or timeline. For example, Marvel Studios could use the multiverse concept introduced in Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness to explore alternate realities where Tony Stark is still alive or has a different fate. Another option is to use flashbacks or holograms to show Tony Stark’s past or legacy. For example, Marvel Studios could reveal more details about his relationship with his father Howard Stark or his mentor Obadiah Stane.</p><p>Another option is to focus on a new character who becomes the new Iron Man or inherits his technology. For example, Marvel Studios could introduce Riri Williams, a teenage genius who builds her own suit of armor and becomes Ironheart. Riri Williams is confirmed to appear in her own Disney Plus series, but she could also appear in a movie alongside other MCU heroes. Another example is James Rhodes, Tony Stark’s best friend and ally who wears the War Machine armor. Rhodes is confirmed to star in his own Disney Plus series called Armor Wars, which will deal with the fallout of Tony Stark’s technology falling into the wrong hands. Rhodes could also lead or join a new team of heroes in a movie.</p><p>A third option is to bring back Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in some form or capacity. For example, Marvel Studios could use CGI or de-aging technology to show a younger version of Tony Stark in a prequel or origin story. Another example is to use of voice acting or motion capture to show Tony Stark as an AI or a hologram who guides or mentors other characters. A third example is to use of resurrection or time travel to bring back Tony Stark from the dead or from another timeline.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: <a href=# data-type=link data-id=//https://www.newsunzip.com/entertainment/only-murders-in-the-building-season-4-release-date/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Only Murders In The Building Season 4 Release Date</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Will_Be_Involved_in_Iron_Man_4></span>Who Will Be Involved in Iron Man 4?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The cast and crew of Iron Man 4 will depend on what the movie will be about and who will be the main character. If Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark, he will likely reprise his role as the lead actor. However, if a new character becomes the new Iron Man or inherits his technology, he or she will likely take over as the lead actor. Some potential candidates include Dominique Thorne as Riri Williams/Ironheart, Don Cheadle as James Rhodes/War Machine, Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, or Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts/Rescue.</p><p>The director of Iron Man 4 will also depend on what the movie will be about and who will be the main character. Some potential candidates include Jon Favreau, who directed the first two Iron Man movies and is an executive producer of the MCU, the Russo brothers, who directed Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame and have a close relationship with Robert Downey Jr., or a new director who can bring a fresh perspective to the franchise.</p><p>The writer of Iron Man 4 will also depend on what the movie will be about and who will be the main character. Some potential candidates include Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who wrote the scripts for Captain America: The First Avenger, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, Drew Pearce, who co-wrote the script for Iron Man 3 and created the Marvel One-Shot All Hail the King, or a new writer who can craft a compelling story for the new or returning characters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/When-Will-Iron-Man-4-Be-Released.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Will_Iron_Man_4_Be_Released></span>When Will Iron Man 4 Be Released?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since Iron Man 4 has not been officially announced, there is no release date for the movie as of October 8, 2023. However, based on Marvel Studios’ current schedule, the earliest possible release date for Iron Man 4 could be in 2025 or 2026. Marvel Studios has already announced its slate of movies for Phase Four of the MCU, which will run from 2021 to 2023. These movies include Black Widow, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Eternals, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Thor: Love and Thunder, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, The Marvels, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Fantastic Four, Blade, Captain America 4, and Deadpool 3. Marvel Studios has also announced its slate of shows for Disney Plus, which will run from 2021 to 2024. These shows include WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki, What If…?, Hawkeye, Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight, She-Hulk, Secret Invasion, Ironheart, Armor Wars, I Am Groot, Echo, Agatha: House of Harkness, and X-Men ’97.</p><p>Therefore, if Iron Man 4 does happen, it will likely be part of Phase Five of the MCU or beyond. Marvel Studios has not revealed any details about Phase Five yet, but it could include sequels to existing franchises or new introductions to characters from other universes. Some potential movies for Phase Five include Avengers 5, X-Men, Fantastic Four 2, Spider-Man 4, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 4, Thor 5, Doctor Strange 3, Black Panther 3, The Marvels 2, Ant-Man and the Wasp 4, Blade 2, Captain America 5, Deadpool 4, and Iron Man 4.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Iron_Man_4_Have_a_Trailer></span>Does Iron Man 4 Have a Trailer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since Iron Man 4 has not been officially announced or confirmed by Marvel Studios yet there is no trailer available for it as of October 8th, 2023. Fans will have to wait for any official news from Marvel Studios or the filmmakers to see any footage from the movie.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Iron Man 4 is one of the most anticipated and rumored projects in the MCU. As of October 8th, 2023, Marvel Studios has not made any official statement or announcement about it. Therefore fans can only speculate about its release date full movie trailer cast and other details based on rumors hints and possibilities. However, fans can also enjoy other Iron Man-related projects on Disney Plus such as Ironheart and Armor Wars which could introduce new characters who could take on the mantle of Iron Man or become his successors. Fans can also hope that Robert Downey Jr. could return as Tony Stark in some form or capacity in future MCU films.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX56%2FsLqMppinZWRiv6a4xJqqnmWUlsGmew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2firon-man-4-release-date.html&text=Cast%2c%20Trailer%2c%20Confirmed%2c%20Full%20Movie%20Details&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2firon-man-4-release-date.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2firon-man-4-release-date.html&title=Cast%2c%20Trailer%2c%20Confirmed%2c%20Full%20Movie%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2firon-man-4-release-date.html&title=Cast%2c%20Trailer%2c%20Confirmed%2c%20Full%20Movie%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2firon-man-4-release-date.html&title=Cast%2c%20Trailer%2c%20Confirmed%2c%20Full%20Movie%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2firon-man-4-release-date.html&description=Cast%2c%20Trailer%2c%20Confirmed%2c%20Full%20Movie%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cathriona-white-suicide-was-second-attempt-unrelated-to-jim-carrey-relationship-long-term-mental-health-issues.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cathriona White Suicide Was Second Attempt: Unrelated to Jim Carrey Relationship, Long-Term Mental H">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./carl-reiner-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carl Reiner Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
