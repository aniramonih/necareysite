He relocated to Sault Ste. Marie was with his family when he was around 18 months old. Additionally, Lisa Blashill Peacock, Deborah Blashill, and Tim Blashill are Jeff’s three siblings. Jeff is the third oldest of the four.</p><p>The assistant coach comes from a line of hockey, health, and academic pioneers. Rosemary Blashill, the mother of Jeff Blashill, was a nurse practitioner who eventually became the Chippewa County Health Department’s nurse director. Similar to him, Jim, his father, was a Detroit police officer before becoming a professor of criminal justice and eventually becoming the dean of Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie. Lisa Blashill, Jeff Blashill’s elder sister, serves as a health officer for the Benzie-Leelanau District Health Department and the Health Department of Northwest Michigan. Deborah, also known as Deb Blashill, was the CEO of Indigo Health Partners before joining Rocket Central as a data solutions analyst. Finally, Tim is a Ferris State University employee who formerly coached the Big Rapids High hockey team. Speaking about his schooling, the former goalie graduated from FSU in 1998 with a bachelor’s degree in finance.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Blashill-1-1.webp alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Jeff Blashill Height, Weight, Body measurement</h2><p>He<span> is 6 feet 1 inch tall. He weighs approximately 80 kg. He has lovely warm black eyes and Black locks. There is no information on his chest-waist-hip measurements, dress size, shoe size, biceps, etc.</span></p><h2>Career</h2><ul><li>The native of Detroit has been a hockey coach for more than 20 years. He most certainly made a substantial income from his coaching career. Similarly, Jeff Blashill must also have a sizable net worth.</li><li>At his alma institution, Blashill began his coaching career in 1999 as an assistant coach for the Ferris State Bulldogs in NCAA hockey. Later, in 2002, he joined Miami University as a Miami RedHawks assistant coach. Then, in 2008, he was appointed head coach and general manager of the Tier I junior ice hockey club in the USHL known as the Indiana Ice. In 2010, the former hockey player at Western Michigan University was named head coach of the Western Michigan Broncos.</li><li>After that, in 2011, Blashill joined the Detroit Red Wings coaching staff as an assistant, and a year later, he took the head coaching role with the Grand Rapids Griffins, the Red Wings AHL affiliate. In 2014, he renewed his three-year deal with the Red Wings organization, and a year later, he was appointed the team’s head coach.</li><li>In April 2019, the Red Wings said they had hired the coach, who was born in 1973, to a two-year contract. In 2021, he agreed to renew his contract with the Red Wings. Sadly, on April 30, 2022, he was fired by the Wings. In July 2022, the Tampa Bay Lightning hired the athlete as their new assistant coach as a result.</li></ul><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Blashill-2-1.webp alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2>Jeff Blashill ’s Net Worth</h2><p>Jeff Blashill received annual compensation of $800,000 from CapFriendly, totaling $3,200,000 during his first four seasons as the Red Wings head coach. He must thus have gotten a raise when his contract was extended for the following seasons.</p><p>Additionally, according to The Athletic, senior assistant coaches with a couple of head coaching stints make between $500,000 and $700,000. The FSU grad’s salary as the assistant coach of the Lightning must also be considered given that he led the Detriot for seven years. Therefore, Jeff Blashill must have a sizable net worth.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Blashill-3-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Jeff Blashill Wife, Marriage, Children</h2><p>The native of Detroit is a devoted husband to his girlfriend, Erica Blashill. The latter, also known as Erica William Blashill, is a businesswoman and the owner of Plaid Spirit and LEO Marketing. While attending Ferris State University, the two fell in love. Jeff Blashill’s wife complimented his earnestness, determination, sense of humor, and terrific personality in an interview with NHL.</p><p>In addition to being happily married, Jeff and his wife, Erica, have welcomed three children. They have devoted parents to Josie Blashill, their little daughter, and their two sons, Teddy and Owen Blashill. Teddy Blashill, Jeff Blashill’s kid born on February 3, 2006, enjoys playing golf and hockey. Josie, however, is Jeff Blashill’s second child and his daughter. Last but not least, Owen is three years Josie’s junior and is named after his great-grandfather. Little information about the children has been made available since they are all so young. But oddly, Erica’s lustrous light brunette hair has been passed down to all of the little ones.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Blashill-4-1.webp alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Interesting Facts</h2><ul><li>He participated in both junior and collegiate hockey.</li><li>During his seven-year tenure with the Detroit Red Wings, Jeff posted 204-261-72.</li><li>Previously, Blashill held positions as the head coach of the Indiana Ice, the head coach and general manager of the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL), an assistant coach for the Red Wings, the head coach of the Western Michigan University ice hockey team, and an assistant coach at both Ferris State University and Miami University.</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnp6WYq%2BtrdKhoKWkXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeff-blashill.html&text=Jeff%20Blashill-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeff-blashill.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-blashill.html&title=Jeff%20Blashill-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeff-blashill.html&title=Jeff%20Blashill-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeff-blashill.html&title=Jeff%20Blashill-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeff-blashill.html&description=Jeff%20Blashill-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jeffrey-earnhardt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeffrey Earnhardt">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ty-pennington-married-girlfriend-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Ty Pennington Married?
