She is widely recognized for her appearance on television shows such as <i>Counting On</i> and <i>Kids and Counting</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Dugger was born on 21 December 1993 in Fayetteville, Arkansas, the United States of America, where another TV star <a href=#><strong>Broderick Harvey Jr.</strong></a> was born. Born to her American father <strong>Jim Bob Duggar</strong> and mother <strong>Michelle Ruark</strong>, she is of White ethnicity and holds American nationality.</p><h2>Married to Former Soccer Player: Jeremy Vuolo</h2><p>The famous reality star of series, <i>19 Kids and Counting</i> is a married woman. On <i>5th November 2016</i>, Jinger Vuolo exchanged her wedding vows with <strong>Jeremy Vuolo</strong>. Her spouse is a former soccer player who currently is a pastor and television star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/22/Jinger%20Duggar%20Vuolo-1577015190883.jpg><p>The pair first met in 2015 while they were on a mission trip to Central America. From the nuptials, Jinger also shares a child with Jeremy, a daughter named <strong>Felicity Nicole Vuolo</strong> (born on <i>19th July 2018</i>).&nbsp;</p><h2>Richest Kid in a Duggar's Family</h2><p>The main cast of <i>Counting On</i> makes huge money from her profession. To date, she has appeared in various episodes of several shows like <i>19 Kids and Counting</i> and <i>Counting On</i> which added up quite a sum to her current wealth.&nbsp;</p><p>Jinger's total net worth is estimated to be <strong>$2 million</strong> as of 2019, which is a bit less than another TV personality <a href=#><strong>Greg Gutfeld</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Moreover, Duggar and her husband live on<strong> $685,000</strong> worth The Master's Seminary, where the pair pays <strong>$4000 </strong>rent every month.</p><h2>Raised In A Family of full Toxic Thoughts</h2><p>It's been more than a decade that Jinger's parents showed themselves as the paragon of conservative Christian parents by a television show. In the show, Jinger's parents showed how they had managed to control the family by unnecessary rules. As time passed by, Duggar's fans started raising the question regarding her silence and loyalty towards her family's beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, it was revealed that Jinger's brother was very abusive. Jim Bob and Michelle failed to protect their daughter even after their strict rules. Duggar's brother Josh was reported to abuse his four sisters in a erotic manner.</p><p>Only two victims out of four accused Josh of his crime. However, Jinger stayed silent, leaving her fans and supporters in confusion.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jinger Became Free of Harassment After Her Wedding</h2><p>Jinger is said to be escaped from her toxic family, who didn't let her wear fancy clothes and live her life freely. Moreover, she seems to be free from her brother, who treated Jinger like a sexual object.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/22/Jinger%20Duggar%20Vuolo%20free-1577015248977.JPG><p>Since marriage, she made it clear that she is going to wear pants and shorts, but she doesn't show much. But after the nuptials, Jinger posted a photo with her blonde hair as she was living with her partner in Los Angeles. Dugger grabbed huge attention or paparazzi as she was living life against her parents' will. The picture in the shooting range became a quite controversial subject.&nbsp;</p><h2>Initial Career as a Reality Star</h2><p>The television star kicked off her career as a broadcaster on <i>14 Children and Pregnant Again</i>, a 2004 documentary. The film also included Jinger's family, which aired via <i>Discovery Health Channel</i>.</p><p>The following year, Vuolo made her appearance in another documentary, <i>Raising 16 Children</i>. In 2008, Duggar appeared in one of the most popular shows, <i>19 Kids and Counting</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/22/Jinger%20Duggar%20Vuolo%2019%20kids-1577015551696.jpg><p>Since 2015, Jinger appears on <i>Counting On </i>as the main cast along with her siblings <i>Jessa</i>, <i>Jana, </i>and <i>Jill Duggar</i>.</p><p><i><strong>Best Recommendation </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong> For More News & Articles On Celebrities.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqOgp5%2BVp3qlwcagmKtlpqq8rbs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjinger-duggar-vuolo.html&text=After%20Wedding%2c%20Jinger%20Duggar%20Vuolo%20Feels%20Free%20And%20Liberated%3b%20Who%20Is%20Her%20Husband%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjinger-duggar-vuolo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjinger-duggar-vuolo.html&title=After%20Wedding%2c%20Jinger%20Duggar%20Vuolo%20Feels%20Free%20And%20Liberated%3b%20Who%20Is%20Her%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjinger-duggar-vuolo.html&title=After%20Wedding%2c%20Jinger%20Duggar%20Vuolo%20Feels%20Free%20And%20Liberated%3b%20Who%20Is%20Her%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjinger-duggar-vuolo.html&title=After%20Wedding%2c%20Jinger%20Duggar%20Vuolo%20Feels%20Free%20And%20Liberated%3b%20Who%20Is%20Her%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjinger-duggar-vuolo.html&description=After%20Wedding%2c%20Jinger%20Duggar%20Vuolo%20Feels%20Free%20And%20Liberated%3b%20Who%20Is%20Her%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alexandra-paul-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexandra Paul Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./advance-slowly-crossword-clue-nyt-1026582.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Advance slowly Crossword Clue NYT">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
