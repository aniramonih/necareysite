Don Dokken is best known as the founder and lead singer of the glam metal band Dokken. After the band broke up in 1989, he embarked on a solo career with the album "Up from the Ashes." Dokken subsequently reformed his band and continued touring and recording albums.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Don Dokken was born on June 29, 1953 in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2 id=dokken><strong>Dokken</strong></h2><p>In the late 1970s, Dokken played with the Los Angeles-based band Airborn. After seeing a performance by the band Xciter, he tried to recruit that band's members <a href=# title="George Lynch Net Worth">George Lynch</a> and Mick Brown to form a new group. The two initially declined, but eventually accepted. Along with bassist Juan Croucier, the group became the glam metal band Dokken. The band went on to release its debut studio album, "Breakin' the Chains," in Europe in 1981. Two years after that, the album was remixed and partially re-recorded for release in the United States. Dokken released its second studio album, "Tooth and Nail," in 1984; it was the band's first album with bassist <a href=# title="Jeff Pilson Net Worth">Jeff Pilson</a> following the departure of Croucier. "Tooth and Nail" was followed in late 1985 by "Under Lock and Key," which yielded the successful singles "The Hunter" and "In My Dreams." In late 1987, Dokken released "Back for the Attack," which became its best-selling album and peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200. Dokken recorded the live album "Beast from the East" while promoting "Back for the Attack" in Japan; that album came out in 1988 and earned Dokken its first and only Grammy Award nomination, for Best Metal Performance. The band subsequently broke up in early 1989 due to creative and personal differences.</p><p>In late 1993, the members of Dokken reunited to create new material and continue touring. The band's first new studio album as a reformed group was "Dysfunctional," which came out in 1995. It was followed by "Shadowlife" in 1997 and "Erase the Slate" in 1999; the latter was the band's final studio album with Jeff Pilson, and the only one with guitarist Reb Beach. Dokken recorded its next studio album, "Long Way Home," with guitarist John Norum and bassist Barry Sparks. It was released in 2002. The band's subsequent studio album, 2004's "Hell to Pay," was the first to feature lead guitarist Jon Levin. Dokken released its tenth studio album, "Lightning Strikes Again," in 2007; it was the last to feature Sparks and Brown. The band didn't release its next studio album, "Broken Bones," until 2012. After an even longer break, Dokken released its twelfth studio album, "Heaven Comes Down," in 2023. It was preceded by the single "Fugitive." The band has also released several compilation albums and live albums over the years.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-219704 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Don-Dokken.jpg alt="Don Dokken" width=416 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-219704 class=wp-caption-text>David Livingston/Getty Images</p><h2 id=solo-career><strong>Solo Career</strong></h2><p>After his band broke up in 1989, Dokken embarked on a solo career.
