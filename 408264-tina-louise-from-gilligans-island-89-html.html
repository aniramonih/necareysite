However, not to reprise another industry role but to seek justice for not being compensated for the Ginger doll that Warner Bros. has made in her likeness.</p><h2 style=text-align:center class=_g><strong class=Ug>Tina Louise Speaks Out about Warner Bros.' Ginger Doll Mishap</strong></h2><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Warner Bros. recently created a line of dolls based on Louise's Ginger character from "Gilligan's Island." According to Louise, the company that produced the doll left her out of reaping any financial profit from the product. <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://nypost.com/2023/06/17/tina-louise-says-shes-been-stiffed-by-makers-of-ginger-doll/>The toy</a>, which is the spitting image of Louise, was released on February 27 and costs $12.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Everything from what she wore, referencing popular catchphrases from the sitcom in their ads, to Louise's distinctive beauty mark on her cheek, was used to produce the doll. According to Louise, she only found out about the doll when her daughter informed her, and fans started asking her to sign her autograph on their dolls.</p><h3 style=text-align:initial class=ah><strong class=Ug>Louise disclosed her daughter, Caprice Crane, as being the reason she left Hollywood.</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Though the star was happy to oblige her fans by signing the dolls, she had an unsettling feeling about what was happening and who was profiting off of her. While speaking with the New York Post, Louise <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://nypost.com/2023/06/17/tina-louise-says-shes-been-stiffed-by-makers-of-ginger-doll/>stated</a>:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial><i class=Vg>"I'm grateful for what I have. I have enough. But this is not right."</i></p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Deciding to take the issue to Facebook, Louise posted a lengthy statement about her disapproval and grievances. While addressing her fans on social media, she <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/thetinalouise/posts/pfbid02WTt2C1DSfjRP6skGJNFm323FgQYTK35dimqUTMjhMRy9ZBgxv5oU9Me6D3Xa7cnel>exclaimed</a>:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial><i class=Vg>"Unfortunately, I was never brought into the conversation when these toys were being created. [I've] never received a single residual check for 'Gilligan's Island' in all these years of it continuously running."</i></p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>She then details the doll's numerous features that bear an undeniable and striking resemblance to Ginger. She also says that the company's justification for not compensating her is because they based it on the character and not Louise, the real-life woman. Louise <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/thetinalouise/posts/pfbid02WTt2C1DSfjRP6skGJNFm323FgQYTK35dimqUTMjhMRy9ZBgxv5oU9Me6D3Xa7cnel>continued</a>:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial><i class=Vg>"So I am, once again, not being paid for the use of my likeness and not even getting a licensing fee."</i></p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>She ends her statement by asking her fans what they think about the matter and revealing a similar ordeal that happened to her in the past, except in this instance, she was fairly compensated. According to Louise, when previous CEO Ted Turner ran Warner Bros., the company had used the Ginger character in a Diners Club commercial. Louise was fully compensated, showing that the company does not own her likeness.</p><h2 style=text-align:center class=_g><strong class=Ug>Tina Louise Put Her Hollywood Career on Hold to Raise Her Daughter</strong></h2><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Soon after "Gilligan's Island" ended, Louise put a <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.metv.com/stories/tina-louise-took-a-break-from-acting-in-the-early-1970s#:~:text=In%20the%20early%201970s%2C%20for,to%20act%2C%20particularly%20in%20dramas.%22">pause on acting</a> in 1970 for nearly three years. Naturally, her fans wondered what happened to her, and it was not until she appeared in an interview with Detroit Free Press in 1973 that the reason for her departure from the screens was revealed.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Louise disclosed her daughter, Caprice Crane, as being the reason she left Hollywood. When she fell pregnant with her child, she said she found herself at a crossroads between pursuing acting or becoming a full-time mother and providing the best and most secure environment for her baby, of which she chose the latter.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Her daughter comes from her previous marriage to TV host and actor Les Crane, which ended in 1974. After Caprice started attending nursery school, Louise expressed interest in getting back into acting again.
