However, the likes of Cassandra Anderson, Jasmine Shine, Lana Rhoades, and Monica Wright were, at different times, his girlfriends.</strong></p><p>It is no news that celebrities are often under the perusal of the public. More often than not, this close watch on these popular figures is on their love lives. Kevin Durant’s fans have for a long time wondered what the NBA championship star has been up to and what gorgeous woman might have stolen his heart presently and in the past. <span>Below, we have provided answers to these questions and many others which relate to the celebrity’s love life.</span></p><h2><strong>Is Kevin Durant&nbsp; Married or in a Relationship?</strong></h2><p>Kevin Durant has never been married and is currently not in any relationship. Although he has been linked to numerous high-profile ladies in the past, it appears he has chosen to lay back for a while and is currently not linked to any woman at this moment.</p><p>Kevin Durant has never been married. However, he once came close to saying the vows with one of his numerous ex-girlfriends, Monica Wright. Sadly, unlike in most happily-ever-after fairy tales, the duo got separated before they could even make it to the altar.</p><h2><strong>Who is Kevin Durant’s Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>Kevin Durant does not have any girlfriend, to the best of public knowledge. Of course, he could be totally dating someone privately, though.</p><p><span>However, The NBA superstar seems to be focusing all of his attention on his career now. After the rollercoaster of a love life he had, Kevin seems to have taken a break from finding love and now focuses on recording more wins in his career.</span></p><h2><strong>Timeline of Kevin Durant’s Dating History</strong></h2><p>As one of the most eligible NBA bachelors, Kevin Durant has had his fair share of love and women. From fellow NBA stars to top American actresses, KD, as he is fondly called, can be satisfactorily said to have tested the waters well enough. Below is a breakdown of the various women he has been linked to in the past, and how his relationship with each of them came to an end.</p><h3><strong>Kelvin Durant was in a Controversial Relationship with Cassandra Anderson</strong></h3><p><span>KD’s relationship with 33-year-old realtor Cassandra Anderson was most likely the most controversial of all his relationships. </span><span>Although the couple never stated when they officially started dating, they first sparked dating rumors in 2017 when Kevin still played for the Golden State Warriors.</span></p><p><span>Fans of the iconic player first noticed Casandra’s presence in his life when she was spotted watching his game from the player’s spouse’s gallery. Soon after that, the duo started sharing videos of them hanging out on their respective social media accounts. In 2018, Cassandra even featured Kevin’s picture on her Snapchat profile.</span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/ezgif.com-gif-maker.jpg alt="Kevin Durant's girlfriend" width=1600 height=900 sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h4><strong>They Broke Up in 2018</strong></h4><p>Although neither of the couple officially announced their break up or what might have caused it, fans noticed that there was trouble in their paradise when Kevin refused to share a kiss with Cassandra just after the NBA finals in 2018.</p><p>Although most fans chose to ignore that clear sign, it became glaringly obvious that the couple was not meant to be when Cassandra started deleting all of Kevin’s pictures from her Instagram after that.</p><p>Since their supposed breakup, neither of the duo has hinted at what could have caused it. Even more, Cassandra soon deactivated her Instagram account, and the two have never been spotted out together since then.</p><h3><strong>Lana Rhoades Rejected Kevin Durant’s Love Advances</strong></h3><p>Shortly after his breakup with Cassandra, Kevin cast off his oars and tried to get into another relationship. This time, with adult film actress, Lana Rhoades. Although he never accepted or denied the claims, Lana said that she and the basketball star had gone out on a date once. As Kevin Durant’s girlfriend, Lana was also controversial.</p><p>However, unlike in his past relationship, Kevin was the one who was rejected this time around. Speaking on their rumored relationship, Lana revealed that their date was a terrible one. She said that KD wasn’t spicy enough for her and even claimed that he came to the date venue with a backup side chic. A pretty lame move for such a great player.</p><h3><strong>Kevin Durant Briefly Dated Jasmine Shine</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/831d97660901ae0649e1223d98089aaf.jpg alt="Kevin Durant's wife" width=613 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>After his popular breakup with Monica Wright, Kevin Durant supposedly got into a relationship with a gorgeous woman named Jasmine Shine in 2017. However, sources that described the couple as an on-and-off couple claimed that they had known each other way before that. In the same light, the couple was never really open with their relationship, so there is no information on when or how they met. Some people also find it hard to refer to Jasmine as Kevin Durant’s girlfriend.</p><p>Like their relationship, Jasmine’ background is also clouded in mystery. There is no information on her family or life before a liaison with KD. The couple was rumored to have called things off in 2016 when Kevin reportedly sent Jasmine out of his house, so he could focus on the playoffs.</p><h3><strong>Monica Wright Was </strong><strong>Kevin Durant’s Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>Kevin Durant’s most widespread relationship was with WNBA star, Monica Wright. The lovebirds first met in high school and remained close friends thereafter. However, the couple only started dating back in 2013.</p><p>Be that as it may, KD seems to have had his eyes on the WNBA player for quite some time. While speaking about his love life in 2011, he said that maybe what he needed was a girlfriend who played basketball. Tagging Monica in the post.</p><p>For as long as their relationship lasted, the couple was deeply in love and had only good words for each other. About a year after they started dating, Kevin popped the big question, and the two love birds were well on their way to holy matrimony. Sadly, they never made it to the altar.</p><h3><strong>What Happened to Kevin Durant’s Engagement to Monica Wright?</strong></h3><p>Kevin Durant called off his engagement to Monica Wright. Although many fans had thought that the relationship between these two would be their last one, the love birds had another plan in store.</p><p>Barely a few months after his proposal to Monica, Kevin came out to openly declare that he had called off the engagement. While speaking on the surprise disengagement, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kevin Durant said</a> he did what he did because he didn’t know how to love Monica right.</p><h2><strong>Is Kevin Durant Gay?</strong></h2><p>Kevin Durant is not gay, as there has never been any report linking him romantically to any person of the same gender in the past. In fact, rather than gay speculations, Kevin Durant has taken some heat for homophobic comments in the past.</p><p>In 2021, actor Michael Rapaport shared messages that Durant had sent him in 2020. It was quite homophobic, and the basketball player even challenged Rapaport to a fight. It was quite controversial, and Durant had to apologize, though some deemed his apologies <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">unsatisfactory</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecqeraKmXZnCs63Nrapmr5mbsm670Waeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZKGho2KxosDIp55moJmowbC%2B2GacsaicpL%2BmsI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-kevin-durants-wife-or-girlfriend-his-dating-history-explored.html&text=Who%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%27s%20Wife%20or%20Girlfriend%3f%20His%20Dating%20History%20Explored&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-kevin-durants-wife-or-girlfriend-his-dating-history-explored.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-kevin-durants-wife-or-girlfriend-his-dating-history-explored.html&title=Who%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%27s%20Wife%20or%20Girlfriend%3f%20His%20Dating%20History%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-kevin-durants-wife-or-girlfriend-his-dating-history-explored.html&title=Who%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%27s%20Wife%20or%20Girlfriend%3f%20His%20Dating%20History%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-kevin-durants-wife-or-girlfriend-his-dating-history-explored.html&title=Who%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%27s%20Wife%20or%20Girlfriend%3f%20His%20Dating%20History%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-kevin-durants-wife-or-girlfriend-his-dating-history-explored.html&description=Who%20is%20Kevin%20Durant%27s%20Wife%20or%20Girlfriend%3f%20His%20Dating%20History%20Explored" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./highest-paid-qvc-host.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is the Highest-Paid QVC Host?
