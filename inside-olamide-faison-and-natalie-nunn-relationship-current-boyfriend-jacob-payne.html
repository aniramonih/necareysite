As of the year 2022, neither of the couples is still together.</p><p>Faison and Nuun were in a relationship for approximately six years, from 2003 to 2009. The couple eventually broke up and went their separate ways because of a misunderstanding that occurred between them during their time together as lovers.</p><p>In the year 2022, Natale had already found her true love while she was working as a performer in a club. Both sets of lovers have experienced what they call “love at first sight” after their initial encounter.</p><p>In addition, virtually little information regarding Natalie’s previous relationships and exes can be found on the internet or on social networking platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. It’s possible that she doesn’t want her followers and viewers to know about her history.</p><p><strong>Also read:&nbsp;Who Is Chanel Ayan?

In 2011, the couple had their first encounter in a bar in Detroit, where she was making an appearance in connection with her performance.</p><p>During this occasion, her boyfriend who would later become her husband was already there with several of his friends and the promoter of the club. After seeing the football player for the first time, the Bad Girl star immediately developed feelings for him.</p><p>There was more than one source of the fire; even Payne found himself falling in love with her and being drawn to her. Despite the fact that they lived in different cities, the two quickly developed a romantic relationship. Both sets of lovers decided early on to make their romances known to the public, and their supporters were overjoyed to witness them developing feelings for one another.</p><p>But it would appear that the football player could not be apart from her for an extended period of time. After dating for a few of months, her boyfriend Jacob moved to the Los Angeles area. Despite this, he never parted ways with her and remained by her side forever.</p><h3><span id=Bad_Girls_Club_star_Natalie_Nuun_Wedding_Was_Broadcasted_On_Reality_TV><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bad Girls Club star Natalie Nuun Wedding Was Broadcasted On Reality TV</span></span></h3><p>Jacob finally got down on one knee and proposed to his girlfriend after they had been together for eight months. He said that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.</p><p>The two friends, Nuun and Jacob, decided to spend their holiday on the island of Jamaica in the town of Negril. On May 5, 2012, the pair made the decision to walk down the aisle and get married.</p><p>In spite of the fact that the television actress and her spouse wed in a magnificent private ceremony at the estate of a friend in Topanga Canyon, California, the event was later broadcast on television. The presentation had between fifty and sixty attendees, all of whom were friends and family members.</p><p>Later, as she was being accused for making her wedding, she broadcast the film of her wedding on three different episodes of “Bridezillas” on We TV. It wasn’t so much that she wanted to prove anything to anyone as she did so that she could share the experience with her admirers and viewers.</p><p><strong>Also read:&nbsp;Who Is James Tindale Wife?

Natalie endured a challenging labor and delivery, but on April 16, 2017, she successfully delivered a kid who was in good health.</p><p>She made the announcement that she was pregnant in November 2014, before to the birth of this child. People, however, thought it was all an act on her part to gain exposure because she continued to lead her regular life and there was no new information concerning her pregnancy.</p><p>In the meantime, the woman who has already given birth addressed the allegations that had been spreading about her having a miscarriage in an interview with Oxygen. She also suffered with gaining weight in addition to her melancholy. It’s possible that she wants to keep it a secret because it was such a distressing event that she doesn’t want anyone else to go through it.</p><h3><span id=Her_Crumbling_Marital_Status_After_Cheating_Accusations>Her Crumbling Marital Status After Cheating Accusations</span></h3><p>The marriage of Natalie, like many couples, includes both happy times and difficult times. It was found that Bad Girl had been having an affair with her spouse in 2019, which caused a commotion at the wedding of the couple.</p><p>She was implicated in a scandal involving her co-stars on Celebrity Big Brother, Chloe Ayling and Dan Osbourne, in which they were accused of having a sexual relationship. After a night of heavy drinking in London in 2018, Chloe came clean and revealed that she was involved in the behavior.</p><p>After learning about the event, Jacob declared that he would put an end to his connection with her until he found out the truth about what had happened. On the morning of December 6, 2019, he was seen taking his items and leaving the house. As a direct consequence of this, he was observed walking about London by himself without his wedding ring on.</p><p>On the other hand, the couple was seen walking the streets of London together later that week. It’s possible that they got back together and settled their differences.</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jacob-Payne-is-married-to-Celebrity-Big-Brother-star-Natalie-Nunn-229x300.png decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-68033 alt="Jacob Payne is married to Celebrity Big Brother star Natalie Nunn" width=433 height=567 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-68033 class=wp-caption-text>Jacob Payne is married to Celebrity Big Brother star Natalie Nunn</p><h2 id=natalie-nuun-went-to-marriage-boot-camp-with-her-partner-bad-girl-said-she-can-n><span id=Natalie_Nuun_Went_To_Marriage_Boot_Camp_With_Her_Partner>Natalie Nuun Went To Marriage Boot Camp With Her Partner</span></h2><p>The reality star is trying everything in her power to save her marriage, and as part of those efforts, she and her husband attended Marriage Boot Camp together in an effort to improve their connection. She does not feel prepared to put an end to their relationship of many years just yet.</p><p>Nunn disclosed in an interview that her spouse does not approve of her engaging in bad girl behavior such as twerking on the bed or posting pictures of herself on Instagram partially naked. As a consequence of this, she is practicing some self-control in order to refrain from engaging in such behaviors.</p><p>On the other hand, she admitted that there is no such thing as a flawless girl. Even if she succeeds in bringing her level of badness down from a hundred percent to anywhere between eighty and ninety percent, she will still be considered an evil girl.</p><p>On the bright side, the fact that she makes an effort to be kind has helped her to keep her marriage together. They used to have arguments about these topics every single day, but now they barely argue about it once a week. Since returning from the trip, the husband and wife’s connection has become stronger. They take trips with their family and have a fantastic time together.</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Natalie-Nunn-is-an-American-reality-TV-personality-300x244.png decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-68227 alt="Natalie Nunn is an American reality TV personality" width=492 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-68227 class=wp-caption-text>Natalie Nunn is an American reality TV personality</p><h2 id=natalie-nunn-leads-a-successful-career><span id=Natalie_Nunn_Leads_A_Successful_Career>Natalie Nunn Leads A Successful Career</span></h2><p>Natalie Nuun is a well-known TV personality from the United States who has appeared on a variety of shows.</p><p>After appearing in the fourth season of Bad Girls Club, she first gained notoriety for her violent and irascible behavior. Because of how well she did on that show, she was invited to appear on a number of other shows, including Love Games: Bad Girls Need, Bridezillas, Celebrity Big Brother, Baddies, and a great deal of other programs.</p><p>In addition to this, Natalie made appearances on reality series like “Marriage Boot Camp,” which helped to raise her profile among the public. In addition to that, she has recently been promoted to the position of executive producer of the show Zeus’ Baddies and Bad Boys.</p><p>Natalie, in contrast to a great number of other famous people, is aware of how to make the most of her notoriety. She did this while also launching her own company and established herself as an entrepreneur. In addition to that, she is the owner of a fitness brand and a lash and cosmetics company.</p><p>The majority of people are underestimating the TV star’s level of talent. In addition to being a successful entrepreneur and a well-known figure in the media, she is also a published novelist. Straight Like That, Turn Down For What, and From Bad Girl to Grown Woman are the titles of her three books respectively.</p><p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;Does Street Outlaws Star Brandon James Have A Girlfriend?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tooZ6otqWxjKijmqWZmbJussCiqqimXZa7pXnNmquapJmaeq%2FBzadkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXZjCs77Ep6tmmp%2Bus7O1xKebZqKRmLyjec%2BasKedXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-olamide-faison-and-natalie-nunn-relationship-current-boyfriend-jacob-payne.html&text=Inside%20Olamide%20Faison%20and%20Natalie%20Nunn%20Relationship%20%26amp%3b%20Current%20Boyfriend%20Jacob%20Payne&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-olamide-faison-and-natalie-nunn-relationship-current-boyfriend-jacob-payne.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-olamide-faison-and-natalie-nunn-relationship-current-boyfriend-jacob-payne.html&title=Inside%20Olamide%20Faison%20and%20Natalie%20Nunn%20Relationship%20%26amp%3b%20Current%20Boyfriend%20Jacob%20Payne" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-olamide-faison-and-natalie-nunn-relationship-current-boyfriend-jacob-payne.html&title=Inside%20Olamide%20Faison%20and%20Natalie%20Nunn%20Relationship%20%26amp%3b%20Current%20Boyfriend%20Jacob%20Payne" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-olamide-faison-and-natalie-nunn-relationship-current-boyfriend-jacob-payne.html&title=Inside%20Olamide%20Faison%20and%20Natalie%20Nunn%20Relationship%20%26amp%3b%20Current%20Boyfriend%20Jacob%20Payne" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-olamide-faison-and-natalie-nunn-relationship-current-boyfriend-jacob-payne.html&description=Inside%20Olamide%20Faison%20and%20Natalie%20Nunn%20Relationship%20%26amp%3b%20Current%20Boyfriend%20Jacob%20Payne" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-middleton-follow-princess-diana-footsteps-prince-george-sports-day.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Kate Middleton preparing to follow in Princess Diana's footsteps at Prince George's first sports ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-is-marie-bouzkova-worth-career-earnings-and-net-worth-explored.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How much is Marie Bouzkov worth?
