According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons report, Jared Fogle's earliest scheduled release date is March 24, 2029, find out if this is true and when he got caught.<h2>When Does Jared Fogle Get Out of Jail?&nbsp;</h2><p>According to records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Jared's earliest potential release date is March 24, 2029, when he will reach the age of 51. To be eligible for parole, he must serve a minimum of 13 years, which corresponds to at least 85 percent of his sentence.</p><p>In 2019, Jared's attorney, Jeremy Margolis, requested that his client be allowed to seek medical assistance for a specific issue. Margolis stated that Jared had already sought an evaluation from a highly qualified psychiatrist who specializes in such matters, and he intended to pursue the appropriate treatment.</p><p>During his time in FCI Englewood's prison yard in 2016, Jared became the target of an attack by another inmate named Steven J. Nigg. As a result, Jared suffered injuries to his nose and face, causing him to bleed. Steven, who had been convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, was serving a 15-year sentence at the time.</p><h2>Who is Jared Fogle Partner?&nbsp;</h2><p>Jared has been married twice in the past. His first marriage was to Elizabeth Christie on October 14, 2001. However, they divorced in October 2007 without having any children together.</p><p>Jared's second marriage was to Kathleen McLaughlin in 2010. Interestingly, Kathleen filed for divorce on August 19, 2015, mere hours after Jared agreed to a plea deal that ultimately led to his imprisonment. Their divorce was officially concluded on November 16, 2015, just three days before Jared received his prison sentence. As part of their divorce settlement, Jared agreed to pay Kathleen a substantial amount of $7 million.</p><h2>Does Jared Fogle Still have Money?</h2><p>Jared Fogle, an American spokesperson, and motivational speaker, has an estimated net worth of $4 million. He gained significant recognition as the prominent spokesperson for Subway, as well as for his motivational speaking engagements. However, his career took a drastic turn when he was arrested in 2015 on charges related to child pornography.</p><p>During the pinnacle of his success, Jared's net worth reached an estimated $10 to $15 million, with an annual income of $2 million from his role as a spokesperson and motivational speaker. Following his arrest, he reportedly paid his ex-wife a divorce settlement of up to $7 million. In addition to this financial setback, Jared likely incurred substantial legal expenses and civil settlements, resulting in further financial losses.</p><h2>When Did Jared Fogle Get Caught?</h2><p>Jared Fogle was arrested on July 7, 2015, on charges of child pornography and abuse. He pleaded guilty to the charges in November 2015 and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.</p><p>Fogle's arrest came after an investigation by the FBI into Russell Taylor, the former executive director of Fogle's foundation, the Jared Foundation. Taylor was arrested in May 2015 on charges of producing and possessing child pornography. As part of their investigation into Taylor, the FBI found that Fogle had received child pornography from Taylor.</p><p>Fogle's arrest was a major scandal that tarnished his image as a spokesperson for healthy eating. He had been a popular figure for years, appearing in commercials and ads for Subway and promoting his weight loss story. His arrest and conviction led to Subway ending its relationship with him and the Jared Foundation shutting down.</p><a aria-label="twitter url" rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1479412781753540609</a>Expand Tweet<h2>Who is Jared Fogle?</h2><p>Jared Scott Fogle is a former American restaurant spokesperson and a convicted sex offender. He gained public prominence through his appearances in Subway advertising campaigns from 2000 until 2015 when he became the subject of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This investigation ultimately led to Fogle's conviction on charges related to child sex tourism and possession of child pornography.</p><p>During his time as a student at Indiana University, Fogle underwent an impressive weight loss journey, shedding 245 lb (111 kg) between 1998 and 1999. As he had included Subway as part of his diet plan, Fogle's transformation caught the attention of the company, which subsequently hired him as an advertising spokesperson in the following year.</p><p>Fogle's popularity grew, and he appeared in over 300 commercials during his fifteen-year association with Subway, as well as making other media appearances.</p><p>Allegations of Fogle engaging in inappropriate relationships with minors initially emerged in 2007 but did not gain significant attention until 2015 when the FBI discovered evidence that he had received child pornography from an associate.</p><p>Fogle pleaded guilty to charges of child sex tourism and possession of child pornography later that year and was subsequently sentenced to fifteen years and eight months in federal prison. In December 2015, he began serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Englewood.</p><h2>What Does Jared Fogle Look Like Now?</h2><p>There are no recent photos of Jared Fogle in the public domain. The last time he was photographed was in 2015, shortly after his arrest. He has since gained weight and lost his trademark hairdo. He is currently serving a 15-year sentence in prison for child pornography and sex trafficking.</p><p>Here is a description of what Jared Fogle might look like now:</p><ul><li>He is likely overweight, having gained back the weight he lost on his Subway diet.</li><li>His hair is likely shorter and thinner than it was when he was a spokesperson for Subway.</li><li>He may have gained wrinkles and age spots.</li><li>He may have lost some of his muscle mass.</li><li>He may have a more somber expression.</li></ul><br><br><h2 class=faq_title>When Does Jared Fogle Get Out of Jail-FAQs</h2>1.
