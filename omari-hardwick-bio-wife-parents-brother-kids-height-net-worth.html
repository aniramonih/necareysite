starring role as Ghost on the crime drama,&nbsp;</span><span>Achievement</span><span>.&nbsp;The Force revolves around Hardwick’s character, a drug dealer and nightclub owner trying to clean up his business while dealing with the police and personal matters of his life.&nbsp;In addition to acting, Hardwick is also an accomplished poet and athlete.&nbsp;Find out more about him here including his wife, children, brother, height and net worth.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Omari Hardwick Bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>Omari Latif Hardwick was born on January 9th&nbsp;</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;1974 in Savannah, Georgia.&nbsp;His first name Omari stands for the highest reputation.&nbsp;His middle name, Latif, means gentle.</span></p><p><span>Hardwick attended the Marist School in Atlanta, Georgia, where he excelled in several athletic endeavors.&nbsp;He was so good at football that he received scholarship offers from several colleges.&nbsp;He chose Furman University in South Carolina, where he played as a defenseman.&nbsp;Latif spent a year at Furman before transferring to the University of Georgia Athens (UGA), where he graduated in 1996.</span></p><p><span>After graduation, Omari Hardwick tried his hand at the NFL, but his career was cut short by a knee injury.&nbsp;When his footballing dreams fell through, Hardwick (who always had a flair for poetry and theater) wondered what to do with his life.&nbsp;Under divine guidance, he decided to engage in acting.</span></p><p><span>He moved to New York City, where he took acting classes at the Beacon Theater.&nbsp;He also performed at various small theaters in New York.&nbsp;Hardwick struggled for some time and had to work odd jobs to survive.&nbsp;This was until 2004, when he landed a role in the TV movie,&nbsp;</span><span>Sucker Free City</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;Since his humble debut, the Georgia native has never looked back.</span></p><span>He has written at least 4000 poems and has participated in several poetry slam competitions.</span><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>The American actor has an estimated net worth of $1.5 million.&nbsp;For an actor who was homeless and eventually lived off his car, Hardwick did really well.&nbsp;The actor made his fortune from his acting performances as well as his business ventures.&nbsp;He has a production company called Bravelife Films.&nbsp;Despite his busy career, Hardwick is still an avid poet.</span></p><h2><strong><span>parents and brother</span></strong></h2><p><span>Omari Hardwick comes from a family of six.&nbsp;His father’s name is Clifford Hardwick IV while his mother’s name is Joyce.&nbsp;His father is a lawyer while his mother stayed at home.&nbsp;The actor also has two brothers (Jamil and Malik) as well as a sister named Shani Hardwick.&nbsp;Hardwick remains very close to his siblings.&nbsp;One of his brothers lives with him at his LA base and the other lives in Atlanta.&nbsp;His brothers also use their social media accounts to promote his various projects.</span></p><h2><strong><span>wife and children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Latif Hardwick is married to his longtime girlfriend Jennifer Pfautch.&nbsp;It’s not known exactly when the relationship started, but we do know that they tied the knot in 2012.&nbsp;The couple have two children together.&nbsp;They are a daughter named Nova and a son named Brave.&nbsp;Hardwick is fiercely protective of his wife and family.&nbsp;Though blessed with a cool demeanor, he doesn’t take it too kindly when people don’t respect his family.</span></p><p><span>In 2018, a fan publicly accused Hardwick of being rude to her because he refused to take a picture with her.&nbsp;This caused a bit of an uproar and Hardwick had to come out and defend himself.&nbsp;He stated that his reason for declining the photo request was that the fan didn’t even bother to acknowledge his family members who were sitting nearby.&nbsp;According to him, before the money and fame came, his wife (then girlfriend) stuck with him through thick and thin.&nbsp;He explained that his wife saved his life and that he couldn’t stand it when people disrespected her.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight and body characteristics</span></strong></h2><p><span>If there’s one thing most people will readily agree with, it’s the fact that Hardwick is a fine piece.&nbsp;The actor is blessed with solid good looks that are hard to ignore.&nbsp;Hardwick is 1.78 m tall and weighs 85 kg.&nbsp;The tattooed actor also has black hair and brown eyes.</span></p><p><span>Thanks to his looks, Hardwick has been interested in a few music videos such as Estelle feat Rick Ross’s “Break My Heart” and PJ Morton’s “First Began”.</span></p><p><span>He was also named the Sexiest Man of the Year in 2014 by Essence Magazine.&nbsp;The magazine revealed that his style, humbleness, protection, perfect lips, talent, tattoos, dazzling smile and impressive career made him their winner.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
