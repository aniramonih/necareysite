He was born in Oklahoma on June 30, 1914, and during the 20th century, he made a lasting impression on the Native American art scene.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-allan-haozous><strong>Who is Allan Haozous</strong></h2><p>Allan Capron Houser, also known as Haozous, came into the world in 1914 on the family farm near Apache, Oklahoma, close to Fort Sill. Notably, he held the distinction of being the very first member of his family, hailing from the Warm Springs Chiricahua Apache tribe, to be born outside of captivity.</p><p>This held profound historical significance as his birth marked a departure from the tumultuous period following the surrender of the tribe’s spiritual leader, Geronimo, in 1886 and their subsequent imprisonment by the U.S.</p><p>government. Geronimo, who had led the tribe in battle, relied on his grandnephew, Sam Haozous, Allan’s father, to serve as his translator, establishing a familial connection to this pivotal chapter in history.</p><p>At the age of 20, Haozous left his Oklahoman roots behind in 1934 to set out on a life-changing adventure. His goal was to move to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and enroll in the Santa Fe Indian School’s Dorothy Dunn Art Studio.</p><p>He started to investigate the realm of art in a distinctive and captivating manner while learning from Dunn. Dunn’s teaching philosophy discouraged her students from using traditional methods of perspective and modeling, instead encouraging them to find inspiration in their own memories.</p><p>Rather, she promoted a stylized interpretation of Native American iconography. Haozous committed himself to this creative endeavor while he was living in Santa Fe, producing a large number of paintings and drawings. Due to his extraordinary talent and dedication to his craft, he quickly gained recognition as one of Dunn’s</p><p>Career Journey</p><p>Several of the most prominent galleries and museums in the world display Houser’s creative contributions. Reputable establishments such as the National Museum of the American Indian, the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, and the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., are home to his artwork.</p><span class=td-adspot-title>- Advertisement -</span><p>Furthermore, his creations are proudly displayed in important museum collections in Europe, Japan, and North America.</p><p>His legacy as a well-known artist is further cemented by the prominent display of one of his noteworthy works, “Offering of the Sacred Pipe,” at the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York City.</p><p>Houser moved his family to Los Angeles during World War II, where he took temporary jobs in shipyards. He discovered inspiration and a welcoming artistic community at the Pasadena Art Center in this multicultural and dynamic city.</p><p>He was introduced to the cutting-edge sculptures of well-known artists such as Henry Moore, Jean Arp, and Constantin Brâncuși here. Houser’s own creative path would be profoundly impacted by this exposure.</p><p>Houser’s 1948 creation, “Comrades in Mourning,” which was made of exquisite white Carrara marble, was a beautiful example of his artistic prowess.</p><p>Not just for the artist but also for the larger field of Native American art, this work of art rose to fame. The life and work of Allan Capron Houser serve as a testament to the ability of art to cross cultural boundaries and have a lasting influence on society.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-rich-is-allan-haozous><strong>How rich is Allan Haozous?</strong></h2><p>Although Allan Houser’s exact net worth is unknown, his artwork has brought in millions of dollars when it has been auctioned off. 2016 saw his sculpture “Spirit of the Warrior” sell at Sotheby’s for $1.3 million. “Eagle Dancer” ($1.2 million in 2014) and “The Apache Mother” ($1 million in 2013) are two other noteworthy sales.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCty6WYp2WYlry7u9SsZKedpGLEsL7ToWShp6div6qvx2aumqtdqbWmedKcrKWopKS%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fallan-haozous-net-worth-how-rich-was-the-sculptor.html&text=Allan%20Haozous%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Rich%20Was%20The%20Sculptor%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fallan-haozous-net-worth-how-rich-was-the-sculptor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fallan-haozous-net-worth-how-rich-was-the-sculptor.html&title=Allan%20Haozous%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Rich%20Was%20The%20Sculptor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fallan-haozous-net-worth-how-rich-was-the-sculptor.html&title=Allan%20Haozous%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Rich%20Was%20The%20Sculptor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fallan-haozous-net-worth-how-rich-was-the-sculptor.html&title=Allan%20Haozous%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Rich%20Was%20The%20Sculptor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fallan-haozous-net-worth-how-rich-was-the-sculptor.html&description=Allan%20Haozous%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Rich%20Was%20The%20Sculptor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./amazon-black-friday-best-anti-aging-deals.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amazon Black Friday: Best Anti-Aging Deals up to 70% Off">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alexee-trevizo-mom-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexee Trevizo Mom: Exploring the Supportive Figure in a Rising Stars Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
