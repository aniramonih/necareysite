In 2013, he improved with 55 tackles, 5 interceptions and a sack.&nbsp;Going into his junior season (2014), things didn’t go well for the Oakland-born footballer.</span></p><p><span>He was first suspended for a tantrum by his team’s head coach, Chris Petersen, and as if that weren’t enough, he got embroiled in an argument with the team’s assistant coaches during their training session on November 5, 2014. This posed a discipline problem for the team.&nbsp;That’s why he was fired from the Washington Huskies as the news came in.&nbsp;Thus, during his last season of college football, Marcus Peters had only 30 tackles and 3 interceptions in the 8 games he played.</span></p><p><span>Well, like most kids his age and probably every other responsible adult, Marcus would have felt remorse over his suspension and would have admitted that some of his middle school decisions were immature and hurt him.</span></p><p><span>He was drafted into the NFL in 18th place overall in the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs.&nbsp;His rookie deal was a four-year contract worth $9 million, which included a signing bonus of $5 million.&nbsp;With this contract, his average annual salary was over $2 million.</span></p><p><span>As you would expect, Marcus Peters got off to a good start to his first professional season as a footballer, he was named a member of the 2016 Pro Bowl and 2nd Team All-Star, Marcus also won the Most Outstanding Defensive Rookie AP Award and AFC Defensive Rookie Defenseman for December 2014, in addition to numerous other honours.&nbsp;and the recognition that came his way through his skills.&nbsp;He played with the Chiefs from the 2015 to 2017 season before being traded.&nbsp;With the red, gold and white colored team, Marcus Peters recorded a total of 130 tackles, 6 forced fumbles, 5 fumble recoveries and 2 touchdowns.</span></p><p><span>On March 14, 2018, the Kansas City Chiefs elected to trade him for a 2018 sixth-round NFL pick from the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for a 2018 fourth-round pick and a second-round pick. tour in 2019. The Mob Squad then decided to extend his original contract by exercising his fifth-year option.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family</span></strong></h2><p><span>Marcus Peters has Michael Peters as his father, but his mother’s name is unknown.&nbsp;His father is currently a high school coach at McClymonds Warriors of McClymonds High School where Marcus played football and graduated as a youth.&nbsp;The football talents within his family did not stop with him as his cousin Marshawn Lynch is also a renowned NFL player.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body measurements, height and weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>The footballer stands at an impressive height of 6 ft 0 (1.83 m) on which he weighs a hefty 195 lbs (88 kg).&nbsp;Marcus Peters has an arm length of 0.80m while his hand size has been accurately measured at 0.21m.&nbsp;His body stats such as his biceps, chest and height were not revealed.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGilkaewtr%2BMqZytnaKoeqO1zmafnqGXncFuw8SinqGsXZe8pcWMppyaq6Wnsq6xza2qZp6RoratxY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarcus-peters-bio-height-weight-body-measurements-family.html&text=Marcus%20Peters%20Biography%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarcus-peters-bio-height-weight-body-measurements-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarcus-peters-bio-height-weight-body-measurements-family.html&title=Marcus%20Peters%20Biography%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarcus-peters-bio-height-weight-body-measurements-family.html&title=Marcus%20Peters%20Biography%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarcus-peters-bio-height-weight-body-measurements-family.html&title=Marcus%20Peters%20Biography%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarcus-peters-bio-height-weight-body-measurements-family.html&description=Marcus%20Peters%20Biography%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Body%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./maria-bamford-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maria Bamford Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./malcolm-mj-harris-net-worth-3.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Malcolm Mj Harris Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
