It was too interior as if it was only meant for herself. But I was surprised she went unacknowledged for Georgia - which received a nomination for Mare Winningham, so clearly was seen. Georgia was a real tour de force where all of her gifts as an actress came together in a very potent way. I often think of Sadie, her character in the film, and different scenes including her musical performances. How JJL could go from searing revelation to indulgent atonal mess in the span of minutes...she was really dedicated to that character. I liked her in Margot At The Wedding as well (I'm one of the few people who like that film) and a number of other performances.</p><p>Saw her in Proof on Broadway, she seemed to just be walking through a Sunday matinee. It could've been the play though, which was real dinner theatre type stuff, "let's wander off into the wings while we pretend to talk about complicated maths" kind of dreck. It was like no one had ever heard of Tom Stoppard.</p><p>I think for decades she's come across as an intensely private person, focused on her work. I don't think she's ever sought the kind of validation/attention that other actresses do in the media. I remember her saying how satisfying it was for her to be able to buy a small work of art and also about how, at the time (late '90s, probably), she was often invited to the Apple campus. She was a big Photoshop fan (pre-CS) and how she could spend all day working/playing with that programme. I liked that film she did with Alan Cummings, that had a real distinct sensibility. She seems a good sort.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 19</td><td class=timestamp><span>February 12, 2016 6:52 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I don't think JJL has a bitchy bone in her body, she's just a little awkward in interviews. A fellow movie buff friend of mine used to refer to her as a "space case". I was an extra in one of her films, and I spoke to her as she passed by me and she waved back.</p><p>She's clearly not the type of actress who seeks the spotlight, but she is gifted and one of the greatest actresses of her generation. I find it commendable that she consistently takes on gritty roles that some A-list actresses would never dare tackle. It's a crime that she's just getting an Oscar mom after years of astounding performances, but better late than never, I suppose. I never thought she'd start messing with her face, but I guess that's par for the course these days with actresses over 40.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 20</td><td class=timestamp><span>February 12, 2016 7:23 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>[quote]Did anyone else see her in Cabaret on Broadway?

Blair Brown was too young and pretty and John Benjamin Hickey was childish and mannered as always. I liked other casts I saw better. It also seemed like she was playing the Georgia character.</p><p>I think the Georgia overlook was just because of a really crowed year. Nicole Kidman in To Die For got left out too.

She is very close with some family friends of mine. I heard about the Noah Greta thing secondhand often as it happened. Noah insisted she have a baby, even at her age. He seems like a piece of shit, but I only met him once when I was younger. Jennifer is reserved and shy, and I think she can come across as subtlety abrasive and off putting to people as a result.

She's in it for the work, not for the stardom, and she does the bare minimum to promote a film (unless it's something like Georgia, which was a family project). And it's not because she's a bitch, it's because she feels the work should stand on its own. By rights that woman should be on at least her 6th nomination at this point. She's done nomination worthy work in Fast Times, Last Exit, Miami Blues, Mrs. Parker, Dolores Claiborne, (Georgia- I thought she went a bit too far, but...), and Margot at the Wedding. And in a year like 1992 when they were scraping the bottom of the barrel to find candidates for Best Actress, Leigh should have gotten in for Single White Female over the likes of Pfieffer and Sarandon. One could even make a case for her in The Hudsucker Proxy (especially in 1994, when both female acting categories had several slot fillers). But the fact is, she doesn't play the game and Hollywood ignores her, which pisses me off as she's clearly got more talent in her left tit than both Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence, and those two bitches have 9 nominations between them.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 26</td><td class=timestamp><span>February 12, 2016 6:20 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>She is one of my favorite actresses too. Whatever role I saw her in, it stayed with me. She has a haunting, memorable presence about her and it makes me respect her more that she doesn't play the Hollywood game, although I hate seeing actresses winning awards when they're not nearly as talented as JJL.</p><p>One scene that always brought tears to my eyes is in RUSH when Jason Patric's character is dying.
