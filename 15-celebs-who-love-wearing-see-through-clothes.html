That appears to be the mantra of these celebrities. It’s one thing to be seen in something “clingy” working out or running errands, but these celebrities bring it to the red carpets across our fair land, for all to see. Who shows it the best? Here are the celebrities that love to go see through; some maybe take it a little too far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Is it all the attention? Is it the need to feel free? Maybe it becomes habit, hey we all get sick of clothes at some point, right? There is no doubt that this is a thought-out process. No one walks out of the house exposed without realizing.&nbsp;Well, we hope that’s the case anyway. For the record, Courtney Love doesn’t count. Celebrities who wear see through clothing come in all types. Some are elegant (see: Rose McGowan, Liz Hurley), some show a surprising risqué side (see: Alexandra Kerry), and some are clearly in it for the aforementioned attention (see: Lil Kim). You need to find a balance, part sexy, not contrived and hopefully leaving a bit of mystery somewhere.</p><p>Regardless of who or why, we live in an age where if you are a celebrity and wear see through clothing, the paparazzi are&nbsp;going to take your picture. Keep that in mind, celebrities; if you make this choice be sure to rock the hell out of that clothing! Lucky for us, these 15 did just that. Here are 15 celebrities that were too see through…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-carmen-electra><strong>15. Carmen Electra</strong></h2><p>An American model, actress and pop-culture figure, <a href=#>Carmen Electra</a>&nbsp;knows how to strut her stuff which sometimes means showing a little extra leg or peek-a-boo on the red carpet. As a model and actress that has appeared on many magazine covers, Electra has had a lot of opportunity to glam it up for the public. Given she’s appeared multiple times in Playboy, Electra is not the shy type and has no problem showing off the goods to all that want a look.</p><p>Electra has appeared on television as well, starring in the MTV show Singled Out as well as the series Baywatch (yes, apparently she also digs tight bathing suits). She has also appeared in several movies including Scary Movie, American Vampire and Good Burger among others. In addition to her career as an actress she has also dated high profile celebrities including Dennis Rodman and Jane’s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-joanna-krupa><strong>14. Joanna Krupa</strong></h2><p>Joanna Krupa is a model that is famous for her reality television career, starring on shows Top Model, Dancing with the Stars and The Real Housewives of Miami. She also has a classic bombshell look and knows how to rock a simple black knit long-sleeve that’s short on fabric and very tight. Oh, and she apparently isn’t a fan of bras.</p><p>Krupa has appeared on several magazine covers including FHM, Envy, Maxim and many others. She was the named German Maxim's model of the year in 2004 and in 2011 she was named one of the Hot 100 Maxim Models of the Year. Krupa has also appeared twice on the cover of Playboy and has modelled lingerie for Frederick’s of Hollywood. Clearly, Krupa is comfortable with her body and enjoys showing it off. She also appeared in the action film Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon where although the Director didn’t want to cast, she received positive response.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-jessica-alba><strong>13. Jessica Alba</strong></h2><p>An actress and model, <a href=#>Jessica Alba</a> is no stranger to showing off her body and she has always loved to push the boundaries on the red carpet. Alba got famous for her role in the television series Dark Angel when she was just 19 years old. She would go on to star in movies as well, including Honey, Sin City, Fantastic Four as well as Good Luck Chuck.</p><p>Alba has won the Best&nbsp;Actress Teen Choice Award as well as the Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television. She also received a Golden Globe nomination for her role in the Dark Angel series. In 2012 she co-founded a consumer goods company, The Honest Company, that produces and sells household products.</p><p>Bonus Alba fun fact: When young, she appeared in commercials for Nintendo and J.C. Penny. Alba also has the distinction of being nominated for two Razzie Awards - one for the movie The Eye and then again for The Love Guru.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-natalie-portman><strong>12. Natalie Portman</strong></h2><p>When Natalie Portman decided to break out the mesh tank top it was clear she was making a statement. Don’t get me wrong, she if any should wear a mesh tank top, it’s Portman. I’m just saying there is no way she woke up that morning and decided “you know what, today is the day”, no, that is a wardrobe choice that was planned in advance.</p><p>In 1999 Portman got her big break, starring in the movie Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. She then went to Harvard University and also starred in the other two Star Wars prequel movies in 2002 and 2005. In 2004 Portman was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in the drama, Closer. She has since continued her movie career starring in Goya’s Ghosts, Thor and the film Black Swan, the latter winning her an Academy Award for Best Actress and second Golden Globe award.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-fergie><strong>11. Fergie</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Fergie</a>, a pop-culture rock star is no stranger to dressing sexy, and wearing see through clothing is part of who she is. Appearing on red carpets as part of The Black Eyed Peas as well as a solo artist, Fergie always turns heads and isn’t afraid of&nbsp;letting it all hang out for the cameras. Fergie has no issues with baring breasts, legs or even more as she often shows off her backside as well.</p><p>In addition to her time on the red carpet, Fergie has also strutted as a model and even released her own fragrance from Avon titled Outspoken; she has since released three more fragrances. Fergie has a sexiness that comes through her confident style and stage presence. Few have had the success she has experienced with both a group and as a solo artist. Fergie has earned the right to wear what she wants, regardless of how little it covers and what we get to see. In fact, thank you Fergie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-heather-graham><strong>10. Heather Graham</strong></h2><p>When you are known as one of the sexiest celebrities in the world, it makes sense to show your sexy side whenever you have a chance and <a href=#>Heather Graham</a> has never been shy to give everyone a good look at her body. When Graham decides what to wear on the red carpet she apparently follows two rules of thumb: sheer and tight.</p><p>Drugstore Cowboy was where she initially got noticed, leading to roles in movies Diggstown, Swingers and even an appearance on the television show Twin Peaks. In 1997 she got a major break, playing the role of Rollergirl, a female adult&nbsp;star, in Boogie Nights. She has since went on to star in The Hangover movies as well as roles in television shows Californication and Flaked. Graham is also a major supporter of climate control and the campaign Global Cool. She is also supports Children International as a public advocate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-kate-bosworth><strong>9. Kate Bosworth</strong></h2><p>Sheer red on the red carpet works, and if it’s Valentine’s Day, well then we've&nbsp;just hit the trifecta. Unfortunately, it was not V-Day and <a href=#>Kate Bosworth</a> only hit on two. When Bosworth isn’t rocking a see through top on the red carpet she’s an actress and model. She has been in the The Horse Whisperer, Remember the Titans and Wonderland. What Bosworth is really known for is the movie Blue Crush.</p><p>Blue Crush was a surfing movie that Kate got jacked for, working with two trainers non-stop to add muscle and look amazing for the role. She should have probably been cast in the remake of Point Break had it been about surfing (spoiler alert: it’s about anything but surfing). Since, Bosworth has starred in Superman Returns as Lois Lane and also had parts in Still Alice and Straw Dogs. Tell me again, why in the hell did they do a remake of Point Break and not have it be about surfing?</p><h2 id=8-demi-moore><strong>8. Demi Moore</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Demi Moore</a> has been rocking see through dresses for years and always pulls it off in a sexy, yet elegant manner. I guess she needs to keep things spicy given her high maintenance ex-husbands <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a> and <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a>, the former which would also look good in a see through outfit; the latter, not so much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moore has been in the game for years, starting off in the soap opera General Hospital and then going into the movies. In 1985 she struck it big with St. Elmo’s Fire leading to a ton of great opportunities. She would go on to play lead roles in About Last Night…, Ghost (for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe), A Few Good Men, Indecent Proposal and Disclosure. She made over $12 million for the movie Striptease making it the highest fee (at the time) to be paid to a female lead. Since, she has taken multiple breaks from Hollywood, but still keeps herself relevant and in the eye of the cameras everywhere.</p><h2 id=7-lindsay-lohan><strong>7. Lindsay Lohan</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> has worn lots of hats in her day. She is an actress, producer, model and train wreck. Part of the latter comes with being a Lohan, but still. She is also a big fan of wearing see through clothing. It doesn’t have to be a red carpet for Lohan, really any carpet will do. Starting with her first film&nbsp;The Parent Trap, she was destined to be famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2004 Lohan starred in Mean Girls and then in 2005 Disney’s Herbie: Fully Loaded. Both films were critical and commercial successes, making Lohan an actress in demand. From there it was a bit of a downhill spiral for her acting career, leading her to focus on smaller, indie movies. She has recorded two albums, the first selling over 4 million copies, the second, certified gold. She then got busted for a couple driving under the influence incidents followed by stints in rehab centers. Since, she has worked on smaller projects while trying to get her legal issues resolved.</p><h2 id=6-lady-gaga><strong>6. Lady Gaga</strong></h2><p>Known for dressing promiscuously it’s a given <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> would make this list. The singer, songwriter and actress loves to use fashion to compliment her music and seems to believe that in most cases, less is more. Whether her style of the day is elegance, gothic or trashy, Gaga loves to strut around in the least amount of clothing possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a couple of false starts, Lady Gaga released her debut album, The Fame, which was a huge success with the singles “Just Dance” and “Poker Face” leading the way. Her follow-up was built on her previous success, catapulting her into the top ranks of pop singers. The album Born This Way was a worldwide chart topper and since has gone on to release another album as well as collaborate with <a href=#>Tony Bennett</a> on a successful jazz album. She has won six Grammy Awards as well as a Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award, given by the Council of Fashion Designers of America.</p><h2 id=5-uma-thurman><strong>5. Uma Thurman</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Uma Thurman</a> has always been a bit mysterious to me. Daughter of a fashion model and an actress and model herself, Thurman has the perfect body to wear see through clothing and clearly isn’t afraid to do so. Thurman’s career started with a role in Dangerous Liaisons, but it was in 1994 when she got her big break, starring in a lead female role in Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Pulp Fiction she received critical recognition as well, nominated for an Academy Award as well as being nominated for a Golden Globe and BAFTA Award. She continued to star in movies in the nineties with limited success and then Tarantino returned, calling back offering her a role of a lifetime in the Kill Bill movies. Fun fact about Uma Thurman: She is claustrophobic so shooting the Kill Bill scene where she is buried alive was actually horrific for her. The terror is real!</p><h2 id=4-anne-hathaway><strong>4. Anne Hathaway</strong></h2><p>Most actresses are proud of their work and most are proud of their looks. <a href=#>Anne Hathaway</a> is definitely proud of both, especially her breasts which she loves to show off under sheer clothing all the time. What are we supposed to do with this? I guess enjoy the scenery is a good place to start.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She got her small screen start on the series Get Real and then got the lead role of Disney’s Mia Thermopolis. She would win the Teen Choice Award for best comedy. Her work centered around being a role model, starring in movies such as Ella Enchanted, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement until eventually getting into more mature roles in movies Brokeback Mountain and The Devil Wears Prada. She was nominated for an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for her work portraying a drug addict in Rachel Getting Married. In 2006 she made the list of 50 most beautiful people.</p><h2 id=3-rihanna><strong>3. Rihanna</strong></h2><p>There it is! That’s pretty much how <a href=#>Rihanna</a> rolls, right? The same goes for her fashion. Bam! There it is! See through, sheer or just non-existent, that’s her style, leaving sometimes little to the imagination. That’s the way it is when you are Rihanna. I think we can all agree we all wish we had a little more Rihanna in us. Bam! There it is! That’s just a good way to live life…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most famous singers and songwriters in the world, Rihanna continues to reinvent herself through her music, often surprising fans with the diversity and many sides she has exposed to her audience.</p><p>Rihanna Fun Fact: When she was young she won a beauty contest and was a military cadet.</p><p>Bonus Fun Fact: Her legs are insured for 1 million dollars. Somehow, her legs just got hotter. Lucky for us they are usually under a sheer dress…</p><h2 id=2-sharon-stone><strong>2. Sharon Stone</strong></h2><p>It’s strange that <a href=#>Sharon Stone</a> is now considered an old-school actress, but she is almost 60. That doesn’t mean Stone hasn’t and can’t still rock see through clothing. She was one of the early trailblazers in the trend and continues to do so, tending to the more elegant sheer look versus slutty peek-a-boo, but hey, we’re not judging. All see through is good in my book…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stone received accolades for her role in Basic Instinct and then won a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award for her role in Casino. The also received a Golden Globe nomination for her roles in both The Mighty and The Muse. In 2004 she won an Emmy Award for her work in The Practice. Since she has appeared in several movies, but it was Basic Instinct that is still discussed and the controversy of whether she was aware of the level of nudity involved. In her 2011 memoir she finally came clean and admitted to being aware of it.</p><h2 id=1-melania-trump><strong>1. Melania Trump</strong></h2><p>The former models is known for so much more these days, but make no mistake, she is no stranger to wearing see through clothing that goes too far. The wife of President-elect, <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>, she began modeling at the age of 16. By 18 she had already signed with an Italian modeling agency and in 1992 was runner up for “Look of the Year” contest for Jana Magazine. The top three received international modeling contracts.
