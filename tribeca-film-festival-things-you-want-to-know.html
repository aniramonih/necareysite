From its first year which is 2002, it has grown as a channel for independent filmmakers in all sorts to release their work to a large audience.</p><p>Between the years of 2006 and 2007, the festival accepted over 8,600 film submissions and took 1,500 screenings. The festival’s program covers a diversity of independent films incorporating documentaries, narrative features, and shorts, as well as a program of family-friendly films. The festival also highlights panel discussions with people from the <a href=#>entertainment</a> world and a music lounge presented with the <strong><a href=#>American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers</a></strong> (ASCAP) to show the performance of artists. One of the major distinguishing elements of the festival is its artist’s awards program in which newcomers and settled artists rejoice filmmakers by presenting innovative works of art that are performed to the filmmakers’ competition winners. Past artists of the artist’s award program cover Chuck Close, Alex Katz, and Julian Schnabel.</p><p>The festival happens at a few cinemas in April throughout Lower Manhattan, often located in Tribeca but also in the East Village and Chelsea.

Tickets begin as economical as $12, it depends on the time and the film.</p><p>The 19th Tribeca Film Festival, first scheduled on April 15–26 2020, then was canceled because of the pandemic of COVID-19.

The interested audiences are permitted to line up 45 minutes earlier than the show begins, although people may come before an hour to take a seat in the front of the line. If the availability of the seats ends, then tickets are sold in order to those waiting in the Rush line for the same price as the advanced tickets online.
