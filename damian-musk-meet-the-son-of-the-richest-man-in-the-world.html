While his father is a business magnate and investor, his mother is an author. In addition, Damian’s father, Elon, is the chairman, CEO, and chief technology officer of SpaceX, the CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc., and CTO of Twitter, now known as X.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to his father’s prominence and success in the business circle, Damian earned fans’ curiosity. Like his father, he has a passion for science, and since the business magnate’s son revealed his dreams of becoming a physicist, his father’s followers are eager to know more about him.</p><p>Who is Elon’s son? Will he follow in his father’s footsteps? Here’s everything we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-09_04-51-14-fotor-2023080945158-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Damian_Musk></span>How Old Is Damian Musk?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Damian Musk is 17 years old; he was born on January 1, 2006, in Los Angeles, California, United States. Although he is of American Nationality, he has mixed ethnicity. The business magnate’s son has British and Dutch and British ancestry from his father’s side and has Canadian and Swiss heritage from his mother’s.</p><p>Since Damian Musk is the son of the wealthiest man in the world, it’s not surprising that his educational journey differs from most teenagers his age. Instead of attending a regular high school, Damian attends Ad Astra, founded by his father. Elon established Ad Astra with Joshua Dahn to educate his and some SpaceX employees’ children.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike most teenagers his age, Elon’s son dedicates his time to theoretical physics research. Although he is still relatively young, he is already honing his skills. Damian Musk reportedly works for the Fermilab Theory Division and the Caltech INQNET consortium. In addition, he specializes in high-energy physics, focusing on quantum information.</p><p>However, besides his passion for science, Damian also has a strong passion for music. The renowned billionaire’s son’s love for music became public knowledge when a video surfaced on Twitter in February 2021. In the viral video, Damian Musk played the piano for older people. Although Twitter users initially misattributed the video to his brother, Kai Saxon, their father corrected the notion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_Damian_Musks_Parents_Still_Together></span>Are Damian Musk’s Parents Still Together?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, they are not. The former couple parted ways eight years after they tied the knot in 2008. Elon’s first wife, Justine Wilson, announced the end of their marriage in September 2008, describing it as a good run that sadly ended although it was necessary. In addition, Wilson stated that she and her ex-husband tied the knot when they were young and took it as far as they could.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-09_04-36-41-fotor-2023080944054.jpg><p>Damian Musk’s parents met at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada. It is unclear when the former couple started dating. However, online reports suggest they got together after graduating from the University. After dating for some time, Damian’s parents exchanged vows in 2000. Eight years and six kids later, they called it quits.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the cause of their divorce is unknown, the media claimed that Elon left Wilson for his second wife, Talulah Riley. However, the PayPal founder dismissed the claims and stated that their divorce had nothing to do with third-party involvement. After their divorce in 2008, Elon and Wilson shared custody of Damian Musk and his siblings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Alexander_Musk></span>Who Is Alexander Musk?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alexander is Damian’s oldest sibling, born in 2002 to Wilson and Elon, two years after they tied the knot. Unfortunately, the couple’s first son died ten weeks after birth from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Aside from Alexander, Damian Musk has four siblings from his parent’s marriage and five from his father’s other relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>After Alexander comes Damian’s twin siblings, Griffin and Xavier Musk, who has since transitioned to a woman, Vivian Jenna Wilson. The twins were born through IVF in April 2004 and are nineteen. Afterward, Damian Musk and his two brothers, Kai, and Saxon Musk, were born triplets. Like with the twins, they were also born through IVF and are the last kids the couple had together.</p><p>Next is X-AE A-XII Musk, who the business tycoon had from his relationship with singer Grimes. The couple had their son, whose name had many confused, in 2020. Afterward, Elon and Grimes welcomed a second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk (nicknamed “Y”), via surrogacy in December 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>In November 2021, Damian Musk’s last siblings were born from an affair between his father and <a href=#>Shivon Zills</a>, the director of operations and special projects at Neuralink. Although the twins’ identity is unknown, their birth sparked an outrage about workplace ethics, given that Zills worked with Elon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-09_04-36-21-fotor-2023080944017-1024x768.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Elon_Musk_and_Damian_Musk_Have_a_Good_Relationship></span>Do Elon Musk and Damian Musk Have a Good Relationship?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, they do. Despite his parent’s divorce, Damian Musk has grown to have a healthy relationship with his father. The celebrity kid grew up with both parents in his life. Although they parted ways, <a href=#>Elon and Justin Wilson</a> maintained a healthy relationship for their kids’ sake and shared joint custody. Also, Elon once revealed that he spends almost all his non-working hours with his boys.&nbsp;</p><p>While Damian Musk has not opened up about his relationship with his father, his brother-turned-sister, Vivian Wilson, has been quite vocal about her relationship with their father. Vivian changed her gender and last name and disowned her father, indicating that their relationship wasn’t solid.</p><p>Like Damian Musk, another celebrity kid who has been in the media is NBA legend <a href=#>Big Shaq’s daughter, Me’arah O’Neal</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksaK5yJqlZqWlqLhuucSeq2asmJp6tLvNZqafZaSdsm6%2ByJyfnqukYrqiuoyipWasmJp6uLvRpZto</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdamian-musk-meet-the-son-of-the-richest-man-in-the-world.html&text=Damian%20Musk%3a%20Meet%20the%20Son%20of%20the%20Richest%20Man%20in%20the%20World&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdamian-musk-meet-the-son-of-the-richest-man-in-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdamian-musk-meet-the-son-of-the-richest-man-in-the-world.html&title=Damian%20Musk%3a%20Meet%20the%20Son%20of%20the%20Richest%20Man%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdamian-musk-meet-the-son-of-the-richest-man-in-the-world.html&title=Damian%20Musk%3a%20Meet%20the%20Son%20of%20the%20Richest%20Man%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdamian-musk-meet-the-son-of-the-richest-man-in-the-world.html&title=Damian%20Musk%3a%20Meet%20the%20Son%20of%20the%20Richest%20Man%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdamian-musk-meet-the-son-of-the-richest-man-in-the-world.html&description=Damian%20Musk%3a%20Meet%20the%20Son%20of%20the%20Richest%20Man%20in%20the%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dehaven-irby-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DeHaven Irby Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./craig-ferguson-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Craig Ferguson Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
