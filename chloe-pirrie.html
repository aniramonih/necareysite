Some of her other works include names like The Game, Shell, and War & Peace.&nbsp;</p><h2>Where is Chloe Pirrie from? Nationality, Education, and More</h2><p>Known for her stellar acting, actress Chloe Pirrie was born in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. Raised in a high-class family, her father is a lawyer from Glasgow, while Chloe’s mother is a physiotherapist from Chingford, Essex, England.</p><p>According to sources, Pirrie is the only child of her parents, who are no longer together.

There Pirrie enrolled at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama&nbsp;in her second attempt and graduated in 2009.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Since finding her passion for acting, Chloe has rigorously worked her way up in the entertainment business. Even now, at the age of 33, Pirrie is disciplined about her craft and what she shows to the world. It might be just her or her Virgo personality oozing out.</p><p>Chloe was born on August 25, 1987, under the sign of Virgo. Aside from hard-working and diligent, Chloe believes in presenting perfection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/chloe-002.jpg><p>Likewise, this stellar actress stands at 5 feet 9 inches(174 cm) and weighs around 57 kgs(126 lbs).
