He was critically acclaimed for his role and won many awards like MTV Movie Awards for Best Villain and Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Felton has acted in other movies like 13Hrs, <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Ophelia, and The Forgotten Battle, among others.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The actor has released four EPs and four singles to date. While Felton's professional life is well known, his private life has been under wraps, especially his relationships.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tom Felton's Ex Girlfriends&nbsp;</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Many online reports have claimed that at 17, Felton dated singer Melissa Tamschick. Apparently, the paparazzi had caught the duo together in an airport. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The pair were reported in a relationship for over three years — from April 2004 to March 2007; however, there has been no reliable news or source&nbsp;to confirm this relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Contradicting to the rumors of Felton and Tamschick dating, it has also been rumored that Felton was in a relationship with Australian actress Phoebe Tonkin.</p><p>Tonkin is best known for TV series like H2O: Just Add Water, The Secret Circle, The Vampire Diaries, and The Originals.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The exact timeline of their relationship is unknown, but it is reported that they dated from 2006 to 2008. This timeframe overlaps the timeline of his relationship with Tamschick; however, nothing has been confirmed to date.</p><p>Felton's most highly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">publicized relationship</a> was with a stunt assistant, Jade Olivia Gordon. His ex girlfriend is best known for her work in three avengers movies — Avengers: Age of Ultron, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The duo first met during the shoot of&nbsp;Harry Potter&nbsp;and the Half-Blood Prince&nbsp;and started dating in 2008. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Felton was head over heels in love&nbsp;with his then-girlfriend and posted pictures&nbsp;of them together on his Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>His girlfriend even made a cameo in the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">played the role</a>&nbsp;of Astoria Greengrass Malfoy, wife to Felton's character. Unfortunately, after eight years of being together, the couple parted ways in 2016.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Gordon then dated American golfer Patrick Rodgers in 2017 and tied the knot in 2019. They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">welcomed their son</a>, Rafi Rodgers, on December 31, 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>After Gordon, Felton was photographed with a new girlfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In August 2017, The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">Daily Mail reported</a> Felton had been hanging out with a mystery blonde woman. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The two were photographed kissing and enjoying each other's company in Venice, Los Angeles. However, there has been no news about the mysterious&nbsp;woman to date.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>Is Tom Felton Married?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Felton undoubtedly has an eventful dating history. But it seems like he hasn't yet found a person to make her his wife.</p><p>That is to say, Felton has not married as of this time of writing. But he does seem to be on a journey to find his future wife.&nbsp;</p><p>In February 2020, The Sun reported he had joined the celebrity dating app Raya in a bid to find a girlfriend.&nbsp;However, it is not sure if he found anyone from the site.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Was Tom Felton Dating Emma Watson?</h2><p><a href=# rel=follow>Emma Watson</a> is best known for playing Hermione Granger, one of the arch-nemesis of Felton's Malfoy in&nbsp;Harry Potter movies.</p><p>Although Granger and Malfoy hate each other, Watson and Felton are good friends in real life.&nbsp;</p><p>And because of that, the Harry Potter stars have often been speculated to be dating.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Watson, however,&nbsp;shut down all the rumors of their dating. Instead, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told People</a>&nbsp;Felton was her first crush, and she used to like him during the shoot of the first two movies.&nbsp;</p><p>She also noted Felton knew about this, and now that they are good friends, they joke about the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Felton has also&nbsp;admitted that the two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hang&nbsp;out</a> quite often and enjoy time with each other. The pair have posted a few pictures of each other on their social media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In addition, they find time to skate together and learn to play guitar. They also&nbsp;promote each other's projects once in a while.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, during her conversation with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vogue UK</a>, Watson again shut down the rumors of her dating anyone. and said that she was happy being "self partnered."</p><p>As of 2022, Watson is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumored to be dating</a>&nbsp;Leo Robinton.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX57AbsDOpmSfnZypvK95zJqpq6GVmXupwMyl</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-tom-felton-married-html.html&text=Is%20Tom%20Felton%20Married%3f%20A%20Look%20into%20His%20Relationship%20History&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-tom-felton-married-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-tom-felton-married-html.html&title=Is%20Tom%20Felton%20Married%3f%20A%20Look%20into%20His%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-tom-felton-married-html.html&title=Is%20Tom%20Felton%20Married%3f%20A%20Look%20into%20His%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-tom-felton-married-html.html&title=Is%20Tom%20Felton%20Married%3f%20A%20Look%20into%20His%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-tom-felton-married-html.html&description=Is%20Tom%20Felton%20Married%3f%20A%20Look%20into%20His%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jupiters-legacy-filming-location-netflix-canada.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jupiter's Legacy Filming Location - All the Places Netflix Series' Season 1 was Filmed!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-bts-eat-pork.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is BTS eat pork?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
