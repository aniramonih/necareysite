As of early 2018, based on authoritative sources it is reported to be $1 million, acquired from his years working in the music industry, which began in the late 1980s.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=mf-doom-net-worth-1-million></span>MF Doom Net Worth $1 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Born in London, England, Doom is the son of a Zimbabwean father and Trinidadian mother. When he was still young, he and his family moved to New York, and he spent most of his time growing up in Long Island.</p><p>Doom’s career started in 1988, when he and his younger brother, DJ Subroc together with an MC named Rodan formed the group KMD. Even before achieving success, Rodan left the group and was replaced with Onyx the Birthstone Kid. The group later on signed with Elektra Records and in 1991 released their first album “Mr. Hood.” The group received minor success, and their early years helped their career and establish their net worth.</p><p>In 1993, just before the release of their second album, Doom’s brother, DJ Subroc died in a road accident when he was hit by a car while trying to cross the Nassau Expressway. The second album called “Black Bastards” was released, but the group was eventually dropped by Elektra Records.</p><p>From 1994 to 1997, Doom took a hiatus from the music industry after his brother’s death, then started attending open-mic events at the Nuyorican Poets Café in Manhattan. He performed freestyles while staying incognito, and later on decided to take a new identity under the name MF Doom.</p><p>Doom also rebranded himself by using a mask during performances, similar to a supervillain from the Marvel Comics. He later on used a mask similar to that used in the “Gladiator” movie. He slowly got back into the music industry, releasing singles including “Dead Bent”, “Greenbacks”, and “The M.I.C.” to name a few. Then in 1999, he released his first solo album “Operation: Doomsday”; his comeback helped his career and also his net worth.</p><p>Doom started gaining success, by also starting to collaborate with other artists as well. He became King Geedorah when he collaborated with the Monsta Island Czars, and he also worked with other artists like Madlib, MF Grimm and Danger Mouse to name a few. His various collaborations also helped raise his wealth.</p><p>After releasing various albums and collaborations, it was only in 2004 that he received attention from the mainstream media. His album “Madvillainy” became a huge hit. and his work was even featured in publications like Rolling Stone, The New York Times, The New Yorker and The Washington Post to name a few. Since then, his albums that followed have become huge successes in their own right, and also helped his income.</p><p>Aside from the success he gained through his solo and collaboration albums, he also received acclaim for his instrumental albums called “Special Herbs”, now numbering seven.</p><p>Today, Doom is still active in the music industry. He recently released the album Westside Doom with Westside Gunn.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Doom is officially single; although he also recently lost his son, Malachi Ezekiel Dumile in December 2017, through unknown causes, there is no information on his relationships.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>MF Doom</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 09, 1971</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>London, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Hip-hop artist, recording artist, record producer, writer, director, “super villain” stage persona</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Malachi Ezekiel Dumile (2003-2017)</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>DJ Subroc, Markham Temple, Rhymes Like Dimes, Rapp Snitch Knishes, DOOMsday, DJ Subroc, Markham Temple, Rhymes Like Dimes, Rapp Snitch Knishes, DOOMsday</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/mfdoom</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>https://twitter.com/mfdoom</td></tr><tr><td>MySpace</td><td>https://myspace.com/mfdoom</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm2237198</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mf-doom-mn0000220563</td></tr><tr><td>Record Labels</td><td>Fondle ‘Em, Metal Face, Nature Sounds, Stones Throw, Lex, Rhymesayers, Elektra, Sub Verse, Big Dada</td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>Madvillainy (2004), Live from Planet X (2005), Expektoration (2010), Operation: Doomsday (1999), Take Me to Your Leader (2003), Vaudeville Villain (2003), Venomous Villain (2004), Mm..
