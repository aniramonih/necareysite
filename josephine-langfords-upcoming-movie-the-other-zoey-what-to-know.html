She begins to <a href=#>reconsider her stance on love when another student confuses</a> her for his girlfriend, also named Zoey.”</p><p>The Other Zoey is one of Langford’s many projects after her breakthrough role in the After film franchise. Since bringing Tessa Young to life, the actress has gone on to appear in Moxie and Gigi & Nate. She also scored roles on the small screen in Day by Day and Into the Dark.</p><p>The After movies, which are <a href=#>based on a series of books written by <strong>Anna Todd</strong></a>, explores the tumultuous relationship between Tessa and her mysterious fellow college student Hardin (<strong>Hero Fiennes</strong>). The story centers on <a href=#>the couple’s complicated love story</a> and follows them well into adulthood.</p><p>Langford recently made headlines <a href=#>when she was noticeably missing</a> from the final film, After Everything, which was released in September 2023. Her character appeared largely in flashback format <a href=#>using existing footage of Langford.</a></p><p>Even before fans<a href=#> started to question Langford’s absence</a>, she noted that she wasn’t sure about her plans to return.</p><p>“I would want to come back if it was important, and it made sense,” she explained to StyleCaster in September 2021. “I’m not a fan of overstaying your welcome. It can sometimes dampen a good thing if you’re creating something and it’s canon, and it doesn’t have a reason. I would be very, very, very happy to come back under the right circumstance and if it made sense.”</p><p>Scroll down for details on Langford’s newest project:</p><p><strong>What is ‘The Other Zoey ‘About?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Everything-to-Know-About-Josephine-Langfords-Upcoming-Film-The-Other-Zoey-1.png><p>According to the synopsis, Zoey is a college student who ends up in an unexpected predicament when her popular classmate Zach (<a href=#><strong>Drew Starkey</strong></a>) gets amnesia and mistakes Zoey as his girlfriend. Zoey isn’t able to clear up the situation and promptly ends up in a love triangle when she meets Zach’s cousin, Miles (<a href=#><strong>Archie Renaux</strong></a>).</p><p><strong>When Will ‘The Other Zoey’ Be Released?</strong></p><p>The movie is set to premiere in theaters on October 20, 2023 and later on demand on November 10, 2023.</p><p><strong>Who Else Stars in ‘The Other Zoey’?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Everything-to-Know-About-Josephine-Langfords-Upcoming-Film-The-Other-Zoey-3.png><p>In addition to Langford, Starkey and Renaux, the cast is rounded out with <strong>Mallori Johnson, Patrick Fabian</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Heather Graham</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Andie MacDowell</strong></a>.</p><h3>What Does the Official Trailer Reveal?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Everything-to-Know-About-Josephine-Langfords-Upcoming-Film-The-Other-Zoey-2.png><p>A sneak peek at the film shows Langford’s character Zoey getting involved in a complicated love triangle. She must figure out whether she likes Zach aka the guy who got amnesia because of her or his cousin Miles.</p><h3>What Do We Know About Josephine Langford’s Chemistry With Drew Starkey?</h3><p>“They really did have effortless chemistry. Both Josephine and Drew are so good to work with,” director <strong>Sara Zandieh</strong> shared with Us Weekly in October 2023. “They not only are so great at their crafts — they’re just both such good actors.”</p><p>She added:”Both of them were doing a comedy for the first time. They were both really excited to do a comedy and to work on material that was a little lighter and funny. They were not only really good at their craft, they were really good for production. They were easy to work with. They were very prepared and committed and they did a great job. We had a lot of fun making this movie.”</p><h3>How Did the Film Approach the Love Triangle?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Other-Zoey-Director-Praises-Josephine-Langford-and-Drew-Starkeys-Effortless-Chemistry-4.jpg><p>“I think Zoey has chemistry with both Zach and Miles. And we just ensured that every scene with both actors was just really good and would lead you down that path,” Zandieh explained to Us. “So I think it all is just in the great performances that Josephine, Drew and Archie gave. The performances within the scenes were just all so good. I think that’s what could lead you down both paths.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>How Did Filming Come Together?</h3><p>“We did a lot of improvisation,” Zandieh told Us. “There’s a whole dance sequence where they’re just rocking out and we just let them do whatever they want. It was really fun. I think we let loose a bit on that sequence and that was what was required to get the best performances.”</p><h3><strong>How Has Josephine Langford’s Time on ‘After’ Affected Her Approach for Future Projects?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Everything-to-Know-About-Josephine-Langfords-Upcoming-Film-The-Other-Zoey-4.png><p>“I’ve learned a lot about what I should do and shouldn’t do. I’ve never been a lead in a movie before this,” the actress told StyleCaster in September 2021. “There are so many little things that no one teaches you, and no one can teach on how sets work and all this intricate, behind-the-scenes stuff. Some of those lessons are invaluable. I’ve also grown with these movies. It’s taught me a lot, and I’m super grateful for that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGoq5Wltaq6xGajmqaXm7yzsNJmrKmbn6K2r7OMpqavoZViwamxjKiroZ2iYsewsdhmrqGZpGLBsHnKp6awZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjosephine-langfords-upcoming-movie-the-other-zoey-what-to-know.html&text=Josephine%20Langford%27s%20Upcoming%20Movie%20%27The%20Other%20Zoey%27%3a%20What%20to%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjosephine-langfords-upcoming-movie-the-other-zoey-what-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjosephine-langfords-upcoming-movie-the-other-zoey-what-to-know.html&title=Josephine%20Langford%27s%20Upcoming%20Movie%20%27The%20Other%20Zoey%27%3a%20What%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjosephine-langfords-upcoming-movie-the-other-zoey-what-to-know.html&title=Josephine%20Langford%27s%20Upcoming%20Movie%20%27The%20Other%20Zoey%27%3a%20What%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjosephine-langfords-upcoming-movie-the-other-zoey-what-to-know.html&title=Josephine%20Langford%27s%20Upcoming%20Movie%20%27The%20Other%20Zoey%27%3a%20What%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjosephine-langfords-upcoming-movie-the-other-zoey-what-to-know.html&description=Josephine%20Langford%27s%20Upcoming%20Movie%20%27The%20Other%20Zoey%27%3a%20What%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./karim-benzema-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Karim Benzema Net Worth In 2022: A Real-Time Update On Karim Benzema Life!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jeff-lutz-bio-net-worth-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeff Lutz: Who Is He?
