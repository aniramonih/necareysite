Known as Swiftgron among fans of their relationship, the “Anti-Hero” singer and the Glee actress were inseparable in 2012, but their friendship, like many relationships in Taylor’s past, fizzled out, and they were rarely spotted interacting in public again.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=583 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>It’s impossible to say for sure whether Swift and Agron are still friends today, and this article will not speculate about any romantic connection between the two stars, nor any songs that the singer might have potentially written about the actress. However, while Swift has been seen stepping out with her friends from time to time, it has been a while since Agron was part of that group. The last known interaction between the two happened in 2019, almost a decade after they supposedly met. Here’s a look at Taylor Swift and Dianna Agron’s relationship timeline.</p><h2 id=h-2010-2011 data-injectable=false>2010-2011</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Taylor-Swift-Chord-Overstreet-Cory-Monteith.jpg><p data-characters=747 data-current-count=1047 data-injectable=true>Taylor Swift is arguably the biggest artist in the music industry today, but that can be said for almost every year she has been in the limelight. In the early 2010s, the biggest show on television was Glee, so naturally, Swift and the cast of the Fox show — of which Dianna Agron was a member — crossed paths often at events and professional projects, resulting in off-screen friendships. Swift was even rumored to be dating Cory Monteith and Chord Overstreet, seeing as she used to hang out with them both back then. (Note: she never dated either. They were just friends. We wonder what would happen if she was romantically linked with every girlfriend she spends time with too… Sounds like a flagrant double standard to this writer!).</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Although the musician and the Glee actress were only officially spotted together in 2011, it’s possible they were introduced to each other via common friends such as Monteith and Overstreet sometime in 2010. The first time the two ladies were ever seen out together was in September of 2011, as they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly bumped into each other while shopping at the Fairfax Flea Market</a>. Soon after that, they would become best friends.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/hataestation/status/110739445560516609?s=20</figure><h2 data-injectable=false>2012</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Taylor-Swift-Dianna-Agron-2012.jpg><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>What’s more 2012 than the Hunger Games movies? In March 2012, one of the first known dates between the two friends was precisely out to a screening of the first Jennifer Lawrence-led film. The two took pictures with fans at the theater.

Kimmel first approached Agron about rumors she was dating Tim Tebow, then asked “How does Taylor Swift work into this love triangle?

While they continued to interact on social media on occasion, the only time the pair was seen together in public throughout all of 2013 was during a Fun concert in September in LA, along with Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Around a year later in 2014, they would bump into each other at the American Music Awards, but by that time, it had become pretty obvious they were no longer as close as they once were.
