Immediately after describing his new problematic commitments, he replied, “But there’s also SO MUCH CUTE BABY.”</p><p>Foster has kept his followers informed about the arrival of his daughter by posting pictures of her on his social media platforms. On September 29, 2020, he confirmed that the three-year-old had begun preschool by posting a photo of her.</p><h2><span id=Due_to_Exciting_Tours_Wedding_Bands_Have_Become_Expensive>Due to Exciting Tours, Wedding Bands Have Become Expensive</span></h2><p>Foster and Tracy are, to say the least, an adventurous pair.
