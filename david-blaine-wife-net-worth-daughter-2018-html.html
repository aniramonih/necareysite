The magician&nbsp;has also been a part of various TV shows including &nbsp;David Blaine: Real or Magic and&nbsp;David Blaine: What Is Magic?&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>It's Magic: </strong>David Blaine pierces his biceps in front&nbsp;of an amazed&nbsp;Ricky Gervais in 2017 (Photo: magiciansmag.com) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There are countable accolades regarding his elite career. In 2002 he published a book;&nbsp;Mysterious Stranger: A Book of Magic&nbsp;a collection&nbsp;of his memoirs and a guide to magic tricks. Similarly, his endurance tests also kept getting harder and harder. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Fox News Bret Baier, Coolest Family With Stunning Brunette Wife" rel=follow>Fox News Bret Baier, Coolest Family With Stunning Brunette Wife</a></p><p>In 2004 he spent 44 days caged inside a transparent&nbsp;Plexiglas&nbsp;case overlooking the Thames in London surviving just on water. And in April 2008, he broke the Guinness&nbsp;World Record for static apnea, after holding his breath underwater&nbsp;for&nbsp;17 minutes 4-1/2 seconds.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Know When David Blaine Began Playing Tricks</strong></h3><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The&nbsp;trickster was born on 4 April 1973, in Brooklyn to war veteran father and a schoolteacher mother. He was raised up only by his mother and left his house in his late teens&nbsp;to make it big.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As a kid, David saw a magic show when he was just four years of age, which made a lasting impression on his mind and has been fascinated with magic ever since. After moving to the Big Apple&nbsp;as a 17-year-old, the illusionist began his first foray into the realm of trickery and started doing magic&nbsp;on the street. His first TV appearance&nbsp;came in 1997 when he did&nbsp;David Blaine: Street Magic for the ABC.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>By 2000 his charm had grown multiple folds after appearing in numerous TV shows leading him to be named the Hottest man in the magic of 2000. His feats include being buried alive in a 3-ton water-filled tank for seven days, living in an icebox for 63 hours with little clothes,&nbsp;and standing on a 100-foot pillar for 35 hours.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h3><strong>What Is David Blaine's Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>The acclaimed magician was&nbsp;on the Summer and Spring Tour, starting from 6 May 2018.

He&nbsp;is one of the wealthiest magicians and boasts a whopping net worth of $12 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>During his career, he has not only earned plaudits but also attracted controversies. He was accused by model&nbsp;Natasha Prince of raping her in 2017. David pleaded his innocence, and the case is due to be heard in 2018, with the verdict also likely to come in 2018.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3><strong>Poor David!

The couple dated for a couple of years before separating after David was alleged to have a hookup with Madonna.&nbsp;</p><p>He was also linked with models Bijou Philips,&nbsp;Manon von Gerkan, Josie Maran, Mallory Snyder, and Lonneke Engel at various points of time in the noughties. After brief flings with numerous women, he seemed to have finally settled with&nbsp;&nbsp;French model and actress Alizee Guinochet.&nbsp;</p><p>The magician was reported to be engaged to be married to the French actress. What's more, he welcomed his daughter&nbsp;Dessa,&nbsp;on 27 January&nbsp;2011, with his wife-to-be.

He must be exhausted by now. But turned out, there is no way he gets away in silence after spending a relaxing time with his sexy supermodel friend, Naomi Campbell.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Explore:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Monifah Shelton Accused & Arrested For Friend Death?

Their get together would have long burned down the headlined as a suspected date if one of Blaine's representatives hadn't spilled for the matter with a revelation that their relationship is anything but romantic.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>&nbsp;Naomi and David are not dating. They have been great friends for many years now, but nothing more than that.</p><p>Twenty years of friendship definitely gives them the freedom to spend time together every now and then. But what provokes the enthusiasm is their belonging to utterly different backgrounds. It's hard to believe that the duo of supermodel and magician has no intention of upgrading their relation after 20 years of mutual friendship.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5mut7XDZpmlmZmjsm7DyJ%2BcZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2ackaq0qcDEq2RraGFte6nAzKU%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-blaine-wife-net-worth-daughter-2018-html.html&text=David%20Blaine%20Married%20With%20Wife%20In%202018%3f%20Daughter%20%26amp%3b%20Father%20Time%20Reflect%20Happiness%20Level&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-blaine-wife-net-worth-daughter-2018-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-blaine-wife-net-worth-daughter-2018-html.html&title=David%20Blaine%20Married%20With%20Wife%20In%202018%3f%20Daughter%20%26amp%3b%20Father%20Time%20Reflect%20Happiness%20Level" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-blaine-wife-net-worth-daughter-2018-html.html&title=David%20Blaine%20Married%20With%20Wife%20In%202018%3f%20Daughter%20%26amp%3b%20Father%20Time%20Reflect%20Happiness%20Level" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-blaine-wife-net-worth-daughter-2018-html.html&title=David%20Blaine%20Married%20With%20Wife%20In%202018%3f%20Daughter%20%26amp%3b%20Father%20Time%20Reflect%20Happiness%20Level" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-blaine-wife-net-worth-daughter-2018-html.html&description=David%20Blaine%20Married%20With%20Wife%20In%202018%3f%20Daughter%20%26amp%3b%20Father%20Time%20Reflect%20Happiness%20Level" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ddg.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DDG: Rapper, Age, Height, Sister, Instagram, Net Worth !">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./d-b-woodside-wife-children-age-wiki-biography-net-worth-height-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="D.B.
