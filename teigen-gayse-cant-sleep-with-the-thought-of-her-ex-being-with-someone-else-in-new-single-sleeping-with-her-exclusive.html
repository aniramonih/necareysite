Filmed in Nashville on a beautiful summer day, the country songstress expresses her true heartache in these scenes which she hopes resonates with fans watching.</p><p>“This video tells the story of a person loosing sleep because the one she’s still in love with is now sleeping with someone else. I did this video in Nashville on a beautiful summer day and each location tells a little piece of the story. I love the bed scenes in the field! It was fun to shoot because I really get to express my heartache in these scenes. The back and forth scenes between the myself and the new girlfriend are very powerful and bring the story home,” she shares in a statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Teigen-Gayse-Sleeping-With-Her-Artwork-V1-3000x3000-1-scaled.jpg><p>After picking up her first guitar at the age of 13, it wasn’t long before songwriting became a passion for Teigen. It was the ability to tell her own story, in her own words, that began Teigen’s love for country music. The desire to create pushed her to get an audio engineering degree before striking out on her own as a full-time musician. She continued to feed that passion with multiple trips to Nashville and co-writing with several industry veterans, including<strong> Chad Kroeger, Gordie Samson, Jeff Trott, Dylan Guthro, Baker Grissom, Phil Barton, Patricia Conroy, David Thompson and Buddy Owen.</strong></p><p>After putting in the hard work, Gayse started seeing real results. She made waves online after releasing her single “<a href=#>I Don’t Wanna Fall In Love Anymore</a>” in 2021, which has roughly 3 Million TikTok views to date. She’s even taken home the honor of Trending Track from Stingray Radio while hitting #43 on the Billboard Country Music charts, and amassing over 350,000 streams! An impressive feat for an independent artist, Gayse’s Top 50 single “I Don’t Need A Boy” won Break Out Artist for Acadia Broadcasting and has accumulated over a million streams, with an impressive 39.2 million views on TikTok.</p><p>Keep scrolling to read our full Q&A with Teigen below and let us know if you’re loving “Sleeping With Her” by either leaving a reaction at the bottom of the post or by sliding into our DMs on Instagram at <a href=#>@celebsecretscountry</a>.</p><p>You can connect with Teigen by giving her a follow on Instagram at <a href=#>@teigsxo</a>.</p><p><strong>Celeb Secrets Country: The music video for your new song “Sleeping With Her” is officially out. How does it feel knowing that you’re able to put a visual story behind the track?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Teigen Gayse</strong>: “I am so happy and so proud with how the video turned out. It was the most magical day filming, and I knew we had something special as soon as we were done.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: Can you tell us more about the backstory behind the video’s concept?</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “The music video is about a girl who isn’t quite over her ex-boyfriend – she’s tossing and turning in her sleep because she knows he’s off sleeping with another girl. In the video you can see flashback moments of her when she was with him, and then it cuts to the current moment with his new girl. Those thoughts can be so haunting, and really cut deep.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: We know that you filmed the clip down in Nashville over the summer. What are some of your favorite memories from being on set with everyone?</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “I love our filming location – it is the most beautiful place! We did my photoshoot there for the song artwork, so it was nice to go back to a familiar spot where I knew everyone. I love the people I worked with on this, they made it so much fun and effortless. The bed scenes were my favourite because I feel like that is such an important intimate part of the story.”</span></p><p><strong>CSC: “Sleeping With Her” is currently climbing the charts and broke the Top 40 on the radio. For those who haven’t heard the song yet, can you go more into its sound and what inspired it?</strong></p><p><span>TG: It’s got some edge to it for sure. The words are sad but the song is upbeat and has some punch to it – big guitars and a big sound overall.</span></p><p><strong>CSC: What’s the overall message you’d like for people to grasp when listening to “Sleeping With Her?”</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “For everyone out there dealing with a heartbreak and is still hung up on someone – you’re not alone &lt;3”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TG-5J1A2954-CROP-scaled.jpg><p><strong>CSC: Aside from the success with “Sleeping With Her,” you recently took home 3 BCCMA Awards. Can you take us through that moment when you heard you received these honors? How does it feel knowing that you’re being recognized for your hard work?</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “Getting recognized for something you are so passionate about is the most gratifying feeling ever. It was my first time winning awards, and everyone I loved was there to watch me accept them, it was such a special moment. The kind of moments you dream about.”</span></p><p><strong>CSC: Do you have plans to release more music soon? If so, what can you tell us about it?</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “Yes I do 😉 I can tell you that I am currently working really hard, and have been back and forth to Nashville writing for the record.”</span></p><p><strong>CSC: What are some goals that you’d like to achieve within the next year?</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “I would love to have a Top 10 at Country Radio, go on a tour with one of my favorite artists. Win a CCMA.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>CSC: Since we’re Celeb Secrets, do you have any behind-the-scenes secrets (fun facts/bloopers/deleted scenes/funny moments) from filming the “Sleeping With Her” music video that we wouldn’t know just by watching it?</strong></p><p><span><strong>TG</strong>: “The very last scene I was running around barefoot in that pink dress in the field and I thought I was tough and could do it with no shoes on – but it hurt so bad when I was running around and I didn’t want to seem like a baby, so I just fought through the pain and my poor feet were bleeding by the end of it.”&nbsp;</span></p><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_juliet has-avatar"><img decoding=async data-expand=600 width=80 height=80 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecretscountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/17308999_10212396175003763_1181666831096569491_n-110x110.jpg alt="Juliet Schroder" data-sizes="(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Juliet is the founder and executive producer/host of Celeb Secrets and Celeb Secrets Country.
