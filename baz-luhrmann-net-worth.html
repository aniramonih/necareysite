Baz Luhrmann began to make a name for himself directing theater productions in Australia, then he shifted his focus to film, with his first project being the 1992 film version of his play "Strictly Ballroom." A surprise hit, the film earned Baz several awards and put him on the map as a director to watch. Since then, he has written, directed, and produced the films "Romeo + Juliet" (1996), "Moulin Rouge!" (2001), "Australia" (2008), and "The Great Gatsby" (2013).</p><p>Of the 10 highest-grossing Australian films of all time, four were directed by Luhrmann. He also created the 2016 Netflix series "The Get Down," and as an actor, he had an uncredited role in "The Great Gatsby" and has appeared in the films "Winter of Our Dreams" (1981) and "The Dark Room" (1982), the TV movie "The Highest Honor" (1982), and the television series "A Country Practice" (1981â€“1982). Baz directed a 2002 Broadway production of "La bohÃ¨me," which received seven Tony nominations, including Best Direction of a Musical and Best Revival of a Musical. "Moulin Rouge!" was adapted into a Broadway musical in 2019, and it earned Luhrmann a Tony for Best Musical. Though he did not direct "Moulin Rouge! The Musical!," Baz was credited with Creative Services in the playbill, and he produced the Broadway cast recording. Luhrmann launched the record label House of Iona, and he released the 1998 album "Something for Everybody," which included tracks from his films as well as the hit song "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Baz Luhrmann was born Mark Anthony Luhrmann on September 17, 1962, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. His father, Leonard Luhrmann, ran a movie theater and a gas station, and his mother, Barbara Carmel, taught ballroom dancing and owned a dress shop. Luhrmann grew up in the rural New South Wales settlement of Herons Creek, and he studied at St Joseph's Hastings Regional School, Port Macquarie, St Paul's Catholic College, and Narrabeen Sports High School. Baz appeared in a St Paul's Catholic College production of William Shakespeare's "Henry IV," and he met Craig Pearce (who would later co-write "Strictly Ballroom," "Romeo + Juliet," "Moulin Rouge!," and "The Great Gatsby" with him) at Narrabeen Sports High School. He earned the nickname "Baz" during his youth due to his hair style; the nickname was inspired by the English Basil Brush. Luhrmann officially changed his name to Bazmark as a teenager. He graduated from high school in 1980, and that year he was cast in his first film, "Winter of Our Dreams." In 1982, Baz co-founded The Bond Theatre Company, which performed at the Pavilion at Bondi Beach in Sydney. In 1983, Luhrmann appeared in the television documentary "Kids of the Cross" and enrolled in an acting course at Sydney's&nbsp;National Institute of Dramatic Art, graduating in 1985.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After appearing in several plays, Baz directed a New Moon Theatre Company production of "Crocodile Creek." In 1992, he adapted his play "Strictly Ballroom" into a film, and it earned him several awards as well as a Golden Globe nomination.

He proceeded to spend several million dollars performing a massive renovation. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted Baz and Catherine's plan to live there full-time and kept them stranded in their native Australia. The couple put the six-bedroom, five-bathroom property on the market for a shade under $20 million in March 2022, with Catherine stating, "We just thought, 'This is ridiculous.' The house has been empty for almost three years. And someone should take advantage of it. But it breaks our hearts."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7w6KpnpukpL%2B0e8GasWakpZ2%2Frq3Np2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html&text=Baz%20Luhrmann%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html&title=Baz%20Luhrmann%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html&title=Baz%20Luhrmann%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html&title=Baz%20Luhrmann%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbaz-luhrmann-net-worth.html&description=Baz%20Luhrmann%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./berto-colon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Berto Colon Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./barton-cowperthwaite-tiny-pretty-things-age-instagram-girlfriend-wikipedia-biography-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Barton Cowperthwaite Tiny Pretty Things: Age, Instagram, Girlfriend, Wikipedia, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
