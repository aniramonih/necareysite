Frances Haugen used to work as a product manager at Facebook until May 2021. She has worked for numerous tech and non-tech or social media companies during her 15 years of career. Frances disclosed her identity during an interview with 60 minutes CBS on Sunday, 3rd October 2021. She is one of the worst nightmares for Mrk Zuckerberg as she made some serious allegations against tech giants.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>She was born either in 1983 or 84 as her age is 37 years at the moment and brought up in Iowa City with her family. Both of her parents are professors thus, she developed a strong sense of democracy by attending Iowa Caucuses with them. According to her LinkedIn page, she went to Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in Needham from where she attained her graduation degree with four years of certification in 2006. Later, she went to Olin College and acquired a degree in MBA in everyday administration in 2011. Later, she went to Harvard University.</p><h3>Frances Haugen Career</h3><p>Frances Haugen has worked for various companies notably in computerized firms. She has remained a former employee at companies like Pinterest and Google. During her 15 years of professional life, she has worked with many innovative and media outlets, and most of late she has worked with Facebook until May 2021. According to what she has described herself on her social media page, she was appointed at Facebook in 2019 as the Lead Product Manager with Civic Disinformation Group. Her niche was much more related to counter-surveillance concerns and government rules and regulations.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u853f8742f1f3a70fbb57408de9bee6eb><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Fernanda Gómez Biography</span></a><h4>Controversy</h4><p>The 37-year-old Haugen wrote on her website that she was recruited to Facebook as lead product manager which had a lot of things to deal with democracy, misinformation, and counter-espionage. During her time with Facebook, she became increasingly alarmed about the choices of the company where she noticed that the company tried to prioritize profits over public safety. She further added that the company rather chose to put the life of people at risk. And Frances has collected the courage to blow the whistle at Facebook.</p><p>With her interview with 60 minutes, she revealed that she had seen at Facebook over and over again that there were many conflicts of interest between what makes good for the public and what else is good for Facebook. And Facebook over and over again chose to prioritize its profit like making money for itself. The Wall Street Journal says the Facebook Files project, Facebook Inc. knows in actuality that it is riddled with flaws that are causing harm and often in ways it understands the matter fully. This is the central finding and is based on the internal Facebook documents including the research reports and online employee discussion.</p><h4>60 Minutes Interview</h4><p>Haugen in her 60-minute interview said on 3rd October 2021 that she had a bunch of networks and subsequently it came out to be worse with Facebook than anything she had seen in her life. she said that imagine you know what was all going into Facebook and you also know that no one on the outside knows about it. She knew that what her future would look like and even if she continued to stay on Facebook, a person had to tackle it all while being with the ground themselves.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ub3469d6474387ea9e81241d17e187d1d><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Jose Menendez Biography</span></a><p>According to the CBS news channel, Haugen secretly copied tens of thousands of pages in her internal research. She further said that evidence has shown that the company was lying to the public that it was taking actions against hate, violence, and misinformation. She said about Facebook that the version we are living with Facebook is tearing society apart and is causing ethnic violence around the world. It has chosen profit over safety. It is paying for its profit over the profit of people. With all of these words, she aspires that it would create a big impact on the world and will motivate the regulations to get into place.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Frances Haugen Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Frances Haugen</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>1983-84</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>37 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Iowa City, Iowa, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Residence</td><td>San Fransico, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Data Scientist & Product Manager</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Frances-Haugen-1.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 6” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 168 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 64 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 141 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Gray</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Olin College, Harvard Business School</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Frances-Haugen-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her husband/boyfriend?</td><td>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u3389f6a116fddef219197831371ed769><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Chase Mattson Biography</span></a><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>As of 2021, Frances Haugen’s relationship is quite complicated because some portals said she is a married woman but no such information is available on reliable sources.
