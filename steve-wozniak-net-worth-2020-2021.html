If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Steve Wozniak’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Stephen Gary Wozniak, also nicknamed “The Woz”, commonly known as “Steve Wozniak” was born on August 11, 1950, in San Jose, California. He was born to his father, Jacob “Jerry” Wozniak, and mother, Margaret Louise Wozniak. His father was from Michigan while his mother was from Washington state. He is believed to be of Polish, English, German and Irish descent.</p><p>Wozniak attended Homestead High School and was an extremely bright and intelligent student who was a technology enthusiast. Right from his childhood, he loved electronics, and he often made himself occupied making homemade devices like a voltmeter, calculator, radio, etc. He hardly did any outdoor activities, like playing outdoor sports.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Wozniak flunked out of the University of Colorado, so he enrolled himself at the University of California. He graduated with a degree of BS in Electrical Engineer and Computer Science.</p><p>Wozniak always credited watching ‘Star Trek’ and attending the ‘Star Trek’ convention as a youth inspired him to come up with the idea of founding ‘Apple Inc’.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Wozniak has been married four times. His first wedding was with Alice Robertson, his longtime girlfriend. The couple were married for four years and had a lovely life together. As time passed by, their love faded, and the couple decided to end their relationship.</p><p>Wozniak then married Candice Clark, a slalom canoe gold medalist. They were married for six years and are blessed with three kids. Their youngest child was born after the divorce. After the divorce, Wozniak had an affair with an actress, Kathy Griffin for a short time before getting married to Suzanne Mulkern. The couple was married for almost fourteen years before they got divorced.</p><p>Currently, Wozniak is married to Janet Hill. The couple has been married for ten years now and is residing in Los Gatos, California. He is a Freemason, despite being a non-religious person. Even at this age, he loves playing video games, and his favourite is ‘Tetris’. He has the condition of face-blindness.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 11 August 1950, Steve Wozniak is 73 years old as of today’s date 21st July 2024. His height is 1.68 m tall, and weight is 84 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>It was through a common friend, Wozniak met Steve Jobs, who like him, hated school and had a passion for electronics. Soon, the duo became very good friends while working together on a mainframe computer at Hewlett-Packard.</p><p>Meanwhile, the demand for the personal computers escalated and hence the development of microprocessors. Wozniak couldn’t afford to buy a computer, so he built one, eventually followed by the first generation of ‘Apple Computers’ and titled ‘Apple I’. The ‘Apple I’ was fully designed by Wozniak, right from the hardware, circuit board designs to the operating system.</p><p>‘Apple I’ became the first home computer to display a character on a TV screen in the history of computing. Steve Jobs then took the responsibility of marketing, while Wozniak was busy augmenting their current ‘Apple’ model. What made ‘Apple I’ better from the rest was the fact that it had an easy-to-achieve video capability.</p><p>Wozniak also co-founded Wheels of Zeus to create wireless GPS technology in order to help an average person to find a way to their desired destination. Wozniak left the ‘Apple’ as he didn’t want to be a part of the management anymore. He then provided all the money in an organisation formed by him to support his educational and philanthropic projects.</p><p>Steve Wozniak is one the brilliant person who gave the world ‘Apple’ computers. He has been awarded numerous awards for his contribution to the world of electronics and computers. His biggest achievement would be the time when he was inducted into the ‘National Inventors Hall of Fame’.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Steve Wozniak in 2024</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Steve-Wozniak-Net-Worth.jpg alt="Steve Wozniak Net Worth 2019" width=976 height=599 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>As of July 2024, the estimated net worth of Steve Wozniak is approximately $120 million.
