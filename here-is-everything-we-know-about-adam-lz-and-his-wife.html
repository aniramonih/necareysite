The couple had met each other during their college years at the University of Central Florida, they were both freshmen in 2013 when they met for the first time. Nicole being born on the 10th of November 1994 is one year older than Adam who was born in May, 1995.</p><p>Their relationship started out as a platonic one, and this can be understood considering the fact that they had interests in the same things. Nicole who is the only daughter of her parents and grew up with three brothers was exposed to the world of skateboarding by her brothers, skateboarding is also something that LZ loves, thus, the duo struck a connection and grew their relationship from then on.</p><p>After a while, their relationship progressed to a romantic one and they began dating.&nbsp;In a stroke of fate, the rider had sustained an injury on his foot which kept him from shooting another riding video within the early period that they began dating. Thus, the two had much time to spend together.</p><h2><strong>How Long Was Nicole Frye Adam LZ’s Wife?</strong></h2><p>Following three years of dating, Adam LZ and Nicole Frye married in 2016, they tied the knot in a private wedding ceremony attended by close friends and family. They honeymooned in Europe. <span data-preserver-spaces=true>In August 2016, a month after marrying Frye, Adam acquired his dream house in Central Florida. In one of his YouTube videos, he took viewers on a quick tour around the house, especially the 3-part garage, which he describes as his favorite part of the house.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/lz-wedding-48.jpg><p>Shortly after they began dating and made their relationship official, Nicole was introduced to Adam’s huge online following, many of whom began following her as well. She gained an estimated 90 K followers on Instagram after they started dating. One of Adam’s early videos where she appeared was titled “Webisode 19: Say Something, I’m giving up on BMX” posted in June 2014.</p><p>After their marriage, the rate at which she featured in Adam’s videos increased. She appeared in almost every video and appeared to have some knowledge about Adam’s niche. Additionally, Adam had helped Nicole set up her own YouTube channel which grew to about 100 K subscribers. Some of Adam’s videos where Nicole featured included “Nicole’s Miata: Exhaust, Speedo Fix, and Steering Wheel!” and “15 MINUTE COILOVERS.” Nicole who after their marriage became known as Nicole FZ was also a part of Adam’s business, LXBMX.</p><h2><strong>Why Did Adam LZ and Nicole Frye Divorce?</strong></h2><p>In late 2018, Nicole’s sustained absence from Adam LZ’s videos raised questions about the state of their marital status. Around the same period, Adam also made frequent travels which many suspected was a deliberate attempt to stay away from home as much as he could. The suspicions turned out to be true as the couple revealed that they had been separated for a while in a video posted to Adam’s channel in December 2018.</p><p>In the video which has now been taken down from Adam’s channel, the couple confirmed that they were having issues and had been temporarily separated for a while. Adam revealed that the frequent travels were his way of dealing with their issues while Nicole revealed that she had been volunteering as a tutor of second-grade kids. She had graduated from the University of Central Florida in May 2016 with a bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education (with honors).</p><p>The former couple also added in the video that they did not know what would be the fate of their relationship in the coming months. However, they never mentioned that they were getting a divorce. In summary, they did not say much about the reason behind the issues their young marriage was facing. It appeared as though they were going to work on it but weeks after weeks passed and it became increasingly clear that they two were no longer together and had divorced.</p><p>When Adam released a video via his channel in January 2019 that he was doing a raffle giveaway of a drift car to enable him to pay for some upcoming unexpected expenses, many of his followers suspected that it was for his divorce from Nicole. He was the richest of the duo (having a net worth estimated at $2 million) and considering what exactly led to their divorce, Adam was going to shell out a huge chunk of money in the divorce settlement. Their marriage produced no kids. The racecar driver would later reveal that his new signature moustache look was a result of the split from Nicole.</p><h2><strong>Does Adam LZ have a New Girlfriend Since His Divorce From Nicole Frye?</strong></h2><p>Yes, Adam LZ now has a new woman in his life. Her name is Collete Davis. The couple made their relationship social media official around August 2020 but from all indications, it appeared as though the two had been an item long before then. Collete, like Adam, is a Youtube vlogger and a race car enthusiast. She is a Motorsport athlete. Her YouTube channel is much similar to Adam’s and she has over 250 K subscribers. The couple gave fans details of their relationship in a Q n A session.</p><p>Since their relationship began, both have posted videos of its progress on their respective YouTube channels. Davis also has an entrepreneurial side, she is the owner of House of Prix Motorsport Streetwear global brand.</p><p>While the status of Adam’s relationship is very clear, the same can not be said of his ex-wife Nicole Frye. However, sometime in 2019, a certain Instagram user with the handle @Constantin_Jung posted a photo of himself standing beside Nicole on his page.</p><p>One Facebook user Andrew Beasley quickly took note of this and took a screenshot of the photo and reposted it on his page and subsequently, the post sort of went viral with fans tagging Adam to see who his ex was now with. Many appeared to be making fun of Nicole’s new guy and to stop the tags from coming, Adam shared the photo as well, in a way to tell fans that he had seen it.</p><br><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/adam-lz-ex-wife-nicole.jpg><p>Nicole, however, remained mum throughout the time and did not confirm whether or not she and Jung were actually in a relationship.</p><table id=tablepress-441 class="tablepress tablepress-id-441"><tr class="row-1 odd"><th
