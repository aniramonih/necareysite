Her given full name is Jacqueline Michele Alemany. She is also known as the author of <i>Power Up,</i> an early morning newsletter.</p><h2>Jacqueline's Mother Was The CEO Of The CIT Group</h2><p>Jacqueline's mother, Ellen Rose Alemany used to serve as the president and CEO of the CIT Group which is one of the top largest banks in America.
