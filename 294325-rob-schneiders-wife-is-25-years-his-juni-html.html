Here's more about her private life and relationship with the Hollywood star.</p><p class=dh>Rob Schneider reached Hollywood fame as a comedian for over 30 years, but behind the scenes, he has a much more important role – a loving husband and father.</p><p class=dh>His third time walking down the aisle was when he married his current wife, Patricia Azarcoya. Still, they have withstood several challenges as a couple and remain strong. Azarcoya is also the mother of the actor's two youngest daughters.</p><p class=dh>Like Schneider, his wife is active in the entertainment industry and is making waves as a producer in Mexico, her homeland, and the USA.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Patricia Azarcoya Schneider Shows Her Mexican Roots in Her Cooking</strong></h2></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.suggest.com/rob-schneiders-wife-is-young-enough-to-be-his-daughter/1406/>Born</a> on March 6, 1988, in Merida, Mexico, Azarcoya joined the entertainment industry as a model, which she sometimes still does through her social media platforms.</p><p class=dh>She later evolved into an actress and producer, known for several famous Mexican shows, such as "Guerra De Chistes," "El pelado de la Noche," and "CuentameLove."</p><p class=dh>She made her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://issuu.com/grupoeditorialsimjor/docs/issue__1__add59539c4dde8/36>film debut</a> on "Planeta 5000," a Carlos Val-directed drama that tells the tale of Sergio and Iris and a dangerous group. She also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2317437/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm">starred</a> in "Real Rob" and "Amor es Amor."</p><p class=dh>Beyond her professional career, Azarcoya likes to entertain through her YouTube channel, where she shares different recipes for various dishes, including cauliflower rice and French toast. However, she enjoys <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.yourtango.com/2020335849/who-rob-schneider-wife-patricia-azarcoya-schneider>cooking</a> Mexican food the most.</p><p class=dh>While cooking can get messy, Azarcoya admitted that she was not the best at keeping things in their place. "You are the queen of not putting stuff back in the fridge," her husband <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTB5swzrPds">revealed</a>.</p><p class=dh>Azarcoya features much of her life on Instagram, including her hobbies, such as traveling with her family, being with friends, dancing, and working out. She was even featured on Women's Health Mexico as a fitness enthusiast.</p><p class=dh>She once revealed that pull-ups were her go-to exercise at the gym. However, she also does other workouts and sometimes posts glimpses of her routines on social media.</p><p class=dh>Her love for physical activities is also rooted in her support for the Liga MX football team, Tigres. Azarcoya <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.espn.com/blog/onenacion/post/_/id/4089/tigres-can-count-on-rob-schneider-as-a-fan>influenced</a> her husband to follow the league and become a fan as well. Once, Schneider shot a commercial for the team's charity foundation alongside football star Andre-Pierre Gignac.</p><p class=dh>As someone proud of her heritage, Azarcoya ensures that she can give back to her community whenever the opportunity arises. She is pleased to support different causes and foundations that can be of help, including a fundraiser for the Mexico earthquake relief.</p><p class=dh>The other causes the comedian's wife <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/rob-schneiders-wife-patricia-azarcoya/>supports</a> are Penny Lane and the San Fernando Valley Refugee Children Center. Azarcoya is also an animal lover, but in particular, she has grown fond of birds and has a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://tvovermind.com/patricia-maya-schneider/>pet bird</a> named Sky.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Rob Schneider and His Wife Met at Work</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Azarcoya met Schneider in 2005 while producing a television show he was working on. Their 25-year age gap may have shocked those around them, but it was nothing but a number to the couple. After six years of dating, they realized they wanted to tie the knot.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>On September 14, 2020, the couple welcomed their second daughter, Madeline Robbie Schneider, born weighing 7.6 pounds. Admittedly, neither of their kids was planned.</strong></h3><p class=dh>"Patricia and I were surrounded by our closest friends and family," Schneider said of their intimate wedding, as Suggest <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.suggest.com/rob-schneiders-wife-is-young-enough-to-be-his-daughter/1406/>reported</a>. "It was the happiest day of my life. We had a great time at the wedding."</p><p class=dh>The couple exchanged <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hitched-hatched-hired-184686/>wedding</a> vows on April 23, 2011, at the Beverly Hills Hotel and had their honeymoon in Asia.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Rob Schneider and His Wife Are Parents to Two Girls</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>The following year, the couple was blessed with their first child together, a daughter named Miranda Scarlett Schneider. After 19 hours of labor, Miranda was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/rob-schneider-welcomes-daughter-miranda-scarlett/>born</a> on November 16, 2012, weighing five pounds and 13 ounces.</p><p class=dh>On September 14, 2020, the couple <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/rob-schneider-welcomes-daughter-madeline-robbie/>welcomed</a> their second daughter, Madeline Robbie Schneider, born weighing 7.6 pounds. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/comedian-rob-schneider-talks-improv-fatherhood>Admittedly</a>, neither of their kids was planned. The "Deuce Bigalow" star is also a proud father to Elle King, whom he had during his marriage to London King.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Born Tanner Elle Schneider, the "50 First Dates" star's daughter, did not grow up close to her famous dad. While being raised by her mom, the comedian was busy building a Hollywood career.</strong></h3><p class=dh>Young as they are, Azarcoya and the "Big Daddy" star's kids already have their personalities. "The funniest one is the little one," the actor once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.fatherly.com/play/rob-schneider-adam-sandler-interview>said</a> in an interview. "The dreamer is my middle child. She sees the world as a dreamy beautiful place."</p><p class=dh>Like many other parents, Schneider spent more time with his children during the COVID quarantine and even taught Miranda about Washington while adding humor to their lessons.</p><p class=dh>In one of his Facebook <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/RobSchneiderOfficial/videos/215824566287593/>posts</a>, the comedian asked his daughter why Washington was an important location, to which she answered correctly. However, Schneider had a different comedic opinion on his daughter's remark.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Aside from raising a family as husband and wife, Schneider and Azarcoya are also colleagues and have starred in "Real Rob" since 2015, a show based on the actor's life.</strong></h3><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Rob Schneider's Daughter Brought His Family Closer</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Born Tanner Elle Schneider, the "50 First Dates" star's daughter, did not grow up close to her famous dad. While raised by her mom, the comedian was busy building a Hollywood career. Elle said, as <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.wideopencountry.com/rob-schneider-daughter/>told</a> by Wide Open Country:</p><p class=dh>"I was born out of a Vegas marriage. My parents got married three days after they met. Soon as I was 18, I took on my mom's last name because she raised me, and I wanted to be my own person."</p><p class=dh>However, Elle ended up reconnecting with her estranged father after <a class="me a" href=#>Madeline Schneider's</a> birth. According to the singer, she realized how important family was. "I wanted my sisters to have good memories of me from their childhood when they grew," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/elle-king-reconnected-dad-rob-schneider/>said</a>.</p><p class=dh>She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/elle-king-reconnected-dad-rob-schneider/>added</a>, "Family really is so important. So through that, me just kind of showing up and trying to be good for them really made it easy because there were no bad vibes. When it's about the kids, the bulls kind of goes away [sic]. I love him."</p><p class=dh>Fortunately, it appears that Elle and Azarcoya also seem to have a friendly relationship. They once went on a family vacation, documented on the actress' Instagram account.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Rob Schneider and His Wife Work Together a Lot</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Aside from raising a family as husband and wife, Schneider and Azarcoya are also colleagues and have starred in "Real Rob" since 2015, a show based on the actor's life. Although Azarcoya portrayed a fictionalized version of herself, she was not always cast for the part.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/403e4c5a2709eda1ded5f2bb19635f5a.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rob Schneider and Patricia Azarcoya Schneider during the premiere of A24's "Uncut Gems" at The Dome at Arclight Hollywood on December 11, 2019 in Hollywood, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The show hired different actors to play her role, but each did not seem right. Finally, she decided to do it herself and call it "Real Rob." She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.suggest.com/rob-schneiders-wife-is-young-enough-to-be-his-daughter/1406/>shared</a>:</p><p class=dh>"They didn’t want to have an actress who pretended to sound like she was Mexican, so they got a girl from Spain who was very nice, but didn’t either look or sound Mexican [...]. Netflix bought it after watching five minutes of it. It's been fun – very liberating. I've enjoyed it a lot."</p><p class=dh>The show has reportedly been renewed for a third season, although the date has yet to be announced. For now, fans can tune in to Azarcoya's podcast with her husband, "See What Happens," where they talk about various topics such as parenting, food, jokes, and more.</p><p class=dh>Each episode features a glimpse of their personal lives, views, and differences, having no filter on each other and the audience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbWtianqzu8Fmqpygnpq2pbHRrGSwoZaaeqq%2FjGtsZrGVlr%2B0eceiqmaipaO2b7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f294325-rob-schneiders-wife-is-25-years-his-juni-html.html&text=Rob%20Schneiders%20Wife%20Is%2025%20Years%20His%20Junior%20%20Meet%20Patricia%20Azarcoya%20Schneider&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f294325-rob-schneiders-wife-is-25-years-his-juni-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f294325-rob-schneiders-wife-is-25-years-his-juni-html.html&title=Rob%20Schneiders%20Wife%20Is%2025%20Years%20His%20Junior%20%20Meet%20Patricia%20Azarcoya%20Schneider" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f294325-rob-schneiders-wife-is-25-years-his-juni-html.html&title=Rob%20Schneiders%20Wife%20Is%2025%20Years%20His%20Junior%20%20Meet%20Patricia%20Azarcoya%20Schneider" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f294325-rob-schneiders-wife-is-25-years-his-juni-html.html&title=Rob%20Schneiders%20Wife%20Is%2025%20Years%20His%20Junior%20%20Meet%20Patricia%20Azarcoya%20Schneider" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f294325-rob-schneiders-wife-is-25-years-his-juni-html.html&description=Rob%20Schneiders%20Wife%20Is%2025%20Years%20His%20Junior%20%20Meet%20Patricia%20Azarcoya%20Schneider" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./today-savannah-guthrie-change-to-appearance-sparks-reaction.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Savannah Guthrie's change to her appearance leaves Today Show fans in awe">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./20021031119661.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PETER O'TOOLE TIPPED TO TAKE OVER OLD CHUM'S HARRY POTTER ROLE">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
