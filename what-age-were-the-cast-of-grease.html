Because of <b>child labor laws</b>, it’s easier to cast actors who are over 18 as high school students than it is to work with labor regulations regarding younger actors.</p><p>Moreover, What does Sandy say to Danny at the end of Grease?</p><p>Sandy : Danny… is this the end? Danny : Of course not; it’s only the beginning. Sandy : <b>You’re a fake and a phony and I wish I never laid eyes on you.</b></p><p>Also Why did Sonny take Sandy away in Grease?</p><p>Sure Sonny was a bit of a jerk, but he idolized Danny and would never disrespect him. Chosen answer: It’s so Cha-Cha can go with Danny. You can see Cha-Cha giving Danny the eye. So Sonny took Sandy away <b>for Cha-Cha’s benefit</b>.</p><p>Why is Grease 2 SO BAD?</p><p>Even so, Grease 2 didn’t just fall short – <b>it flopped with gusto</b>. Despite having almost twice the budget of the first film, it barely made back its costs. The film was critically mauled, and – aside from Michelle Pfeiffer, who was likely on her way to great things anyway – it didn’t propel anyone to stardom.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=26_Related_Question_Answers_Found></span>26 Related Question Answers Found<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Sandy_and_Danny_die></span><strong>Did Sandy and Danny die?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Ending (And “Goodbye Sandra Dee”) <b>Confirm Sandy Died</b></p><p>And it’s not just her: Rizzo’s pregnancy scare, the dance competition that Danny wins (albeit with Cha-Cha), the drag race on Thunder Road… Everything ends with a happy ending, no matter what the seeming obstacles.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Danny_and_Sandy_kiss_in_Grease></span><strong>Do Danny and Sandy kiss in Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Danny and Sandy finally get their movie-<b>ending</b> ‘Grease’ kiss, 40 years after it was cut. Danny and Sandy are finally getting their kiss at the end of Grease, 40 years after the smooch was cut from the classic musical.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_turned_down_the_role_of_Sandy_in_Grease></span><strong>Who turned down the role of Sandy in Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“You’re the One That I Want” was filmed in one afternoon. When Olivia Newton-John was cast as Sandy, her character’s background had to be changed to accommodate Newton-John’s background. In the original Broadway musical, Sandy was an all-American girl and her last name was Dumbrowski.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Sandy_die_in_Grease></span><strong>Did Sandy die in Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Ending (And “Goodbye Sandra Dee”) Confirm <b>Sandy Died</b></p><p>Everything ends with a happy ending, no matter what the seeming obstacles. It’s all a little too convenient and then when Greased Lightnin’ takes off for its maiden flight, the reason becomes clear.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Rizzo_pregnant_with_Kenickie></span><strong>Was Rizzo pregnant with Kenickie?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Upon learning that she might be pregnant, she emotionally cut all ties with Kenickie. … At the end of the school year, a carnival is held; Rizzo is seen on a Ferris wheel, revealing to Kenickie that <b>she isn’t pregnant</b>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_class_did_the_T_Birds_flunk></span><strong>What class did the T Birds flunk?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Parker RP9 T-Bird, an American, high-wing, T-tailed, single-seat, <b>FAI Open Class glider</b>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Which_is_better_Grease_or_Grease_2></span><strong>Which is better Grease or Grease 2?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Grease 2 actually has bigger, better and more heightened musical numbers than Grease</b>, if you can believe it. And by “heightened,” I mean the musical numbers in this movie are mostly about sex. But these songs don’t just have a hot bass line, they also have educational meaning!</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_they_make_Grease_2></span><strong>Why did they make Grease 2?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Director Patricia Birch said the movie was originally going to be titled “Son of Grease”. <b>Producers wanted something more straightforward</b>, so it was switched to “Grease 2”. Maxwell Caulfield tried hard to get it changed back, saying that “Grease 2” was a boring title.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_do_Sandy_and_Danny_fly_away_at_the_end_of_Grease></span><strong>Why do Sandy and Danny fly away at the end of Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>However, do you remember when the shop teacher says, “If it were in any better condition, it would fly.” The real reason the <b>car flies off</b> represents that Danny and Sandy are flying into the sunset for their happy ending.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Sandy_and_Danny_really_date></span><strong>Did Sandy and Danny really date?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta certainly had amazing chemistry as Sandy Olsson and Danny Zuko in Grease, but that doesn’t mean they were lovebirds in real life. … But just because <b>they didn’t date doesn’</b>t mean John didn’t have a crush on the blonde beauty during filming back then.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Grease_end_with_a_flying_car></span><strong>Why did Grease end with a flying car?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Why The Car Flies In Grease’s Ending</p><p>The most bewildering part of Grease is when <b>Sandy and Danny climb into a car that takes off and flies into the sunset</b>. … In that case, flying a car into the sunset as a representation of Danny and Sandy’s happy ending makes perfect sense for the movie.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_point_of_Grease_the_movie></span><strong>What is the point of Grease the movie?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Grease represents the <b>transition between the repressive “good girl” 1950s</b> that identified Sandra Dee and Doris Day as the role models of taming a man by using sexual restraint—and the “wild” 1960s ushered in by rock n roll, embracing freedom and adventure through sex and drugs.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_John_Travolta_actually_sing_in_the_movie_Grease></span><strong>Did John Travolta actually sing in the movie Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Travolta ended up singing the number instead</b>, which differs slightly from the source material. … However, Travolta wanted the song for himself and his character, Danny. “I have to be completely honest with you,” Travolta told Vanity Fair in 2016.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_they_lip_sync_in_Grease></span><strong>Did they lip sync in Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Yes</b>! John, now 64, sang alongside Olivia Newton-John and the rest of the cast in the iconic blockbuster. However, he wasn’t always supposed to sing “Greased Lightnin’.” According to a recent article written by Variety, John stole the part from one of his co-stars. … We wonder if Henry would have sung as well as John did.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Stockard_Channing_really_sing_in_Grease></span><strong>Did Stockard Channing really sing in Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Stockard Channing sings lead on two of the tracks</b>; the two tracks remain her only significant contribution to recorded popular music to date. The title track was recorded by Frankie Valli, who had no other connection with the film. … The most successful songs from the soundtrack were written specifically for the film.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Sandy_pregnant_at_the_end_of_Grease></span><strong>Is Sandy pregnant at the end of Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although <b>Rizzo ends up not being pregnant</b>, the fear forces her character to grow and become more vulnerable from the experience, culminating in Stockard Channing’s heartbreaking performance of “There Are Worst Things I Could Do.” By the end of Grease, Rizzo’s relief that she isn’t pregnant helps her realize the …</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Rizzo_get_an_abortion_in_Grease></span><strong>Did Rizzo get an abortion in Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In both the 1971 stage production and 1978 movie, Rizzo had a pregnancy scare after having sex with Kenickie. … And let’s not forget: Rizzo gets lucky it was just a scare, considering what it was like <b>to actually have an abortion in the ’50s</b>.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Rizzo_boyfriend_in_Grease></span><strong>Who is Rizzo boyfriend in Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kenickie Murdoch (Born 1941) is Danny Zuko’s best friend and Second-in-Command of the T-Birds.
