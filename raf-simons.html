Jacques Simons is his father’s name, and he used to work as a night watchman. Similarly, his adored mother, Alda Becker, worked as a housekeeper. Despite this, Raf’s parents did their best to meet his basic needs.</p><p>Raf appears to be the only child in this family, as no other siblings have come forward in the media. He had a vocation for fashion design since childhood, which prompted him to enroll at the LUCA School of Arts in Genk. Furthermore, Simons is Belgian and of white ethnicity.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Also, know about Joel Edgerton’s Bio, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, and Relationship</a>.</p><h2>Raf Simons&nbsp; Age, Height, And Body Dimensions</h2><p>This amazing designer was born on January 12, 1968.<strong> Raf is 55 years old as of 2023, and he was born under the sign of Capricorn.</strong> These sign’s people are said to have quick minds, discipline, and loyalty. These are some of the characteristics of this amazing man.</p><p>Raf is fit and healthy despite being in his 50s. Regrettably, his vital statistics are not available to the media. Also, his secret recipe for getting that body is a closely guarded secret. More importantly, his white skin tone looks great in designer clothes.</p><p>Simons is a designer who rarely appears in the media. The reason could be that he is too preoccupied with his work behind the camera. This Belgian designer walks into the press with a gentleman’s demeanor and never forgets to thank his admirers.</p><p>In addition, Raf has short black hair. His deep ocean blue eyes are captivating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Raf1.jpg><h2>Raf Simons Professional Life</h2><p>Since his arrival in the fashion industry in 1995, Raf Simons has become the epicenter of fashion and one of the most accelerated figures. He accomplished a lot in a few years thanks to his eponymous menswear labor and work as a chief creative officer at Calvin Klein, creative director at Dior, and Jil Sander.</p><p>Raf established himself in pop culture over the course of his two decades of career, emphasizing the young blood through the lens of clothing. His creation is flawless, and it unquestionably reflects the profundity of fashion and design.</p><p>Raf began his career as an intern for Walter Van Beirendonck while studying industrial and furniture design in Genk.<br>Van took him to his first fashion show, Martin Margiela’s Spring 1990, at the time. There, he informed The Gentlewoman of the occurrence,</p><p>“When I was a student, I thought fashion was a little superficial, all glitz and glamour, but this show changed everything for me. I walked out of it thinking, That’s what I’m going to do. That show is what inspired me to become a fashion designer.”</p><h2>More On Career</h2><p>Raf used to hang out at Antwerp’s Witzli-Poetzli café with Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Rizzo, and Willy Vanderperre during his high school years. Soon after, this handsome established his own label and presented his menswear collection in the form of an 8mm film starring Branquinho. Simons, Rizzo, and Vanderperr collaborated with Robie Sneldert to create V Magazine in 1998.</p><p>Peter Philips had painted Micky Mouse on Robie’s face, and he was wearing Simon’s coat. He was featured on the cover of V magazine, which was widely distributed and garnered a lot of attention. Raf, fortunately, also taught some of the fashion insights at Vienna’s University of Applied Arts for a half-decade.</p><p>Surprisingly, Raf was hired to design men’s and women’s clothing for Jil Sander in 2005. As a result, he debuted his first collection in the fall of 2006. This eventually resulted in some new sexuality in the house. He also designed a gown in which the t-shirt was tucked into the skirts. Unfortunately, he left Jil Sander in 2012.</p><p>Simons was hired as a creative director for Dior as soon as he left the company. He made his runway debut in the Haute Couture collection for Fall 2012. This designer collaborated with athlete company Adidas on the Stan Smith sneaker in 2013. His innovative use of bright colors with an “R” detail became a hit.</p><p>Aside from that, Raf was named Calvin Klein’s chief creative officer. The CFDA named this amazing fashion designer the menswear and womenswear designer of the year for his Calvin Klein collections. After Calvin Klein, he is also the first designer to win both the men’s and women’s awards in the same year.</p><h2>Raf Simons Relationship Status</h2><p>Raf was rumored to have dated Veronique Branquinho in college, according to reliable sources. Not to mention that she is a fantastic fashion designer. They ran into each other in college, and the rest is history. A mystery, to be precise.</p><p>The lovey-dovey couple split up for unknown reasons. Since then, Simons has prioritized his career over such concerns. That could be why this Belgian man has been involved in any rumors or controversy. Whatever the reason, we are delighted to see him living a lavish lifestyle.</p><p>Simons is not married or engaged. He is completely dedicated to his profession. In addition, he has no biological or adopted children.</p><h2>Raf Simons Net Worth 2023</h2><p>Raf has made significant contributions to the fashion industry in recent years. <strong>As a result, he was bound to make a lot of money. Simons’ net worth was estimated to be $20 million as of November 2023.</strong> However, no confirmation has been received from any source.</p><p>This amount is quite small in comparison to his hard work, creativity, and talent. Until now, his annual salary and income have not been disclosed in the media. We’ll reveal it soon; in the meantime, stay tuned.</p><h2>Social Media</h2><p>Her Instagram has a total of 988k followers.</p><h2>Facts</h2><li>He is currently single.</li><li>He is active on Instagram.</li><li>He likes to draw.</li><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Also, know about Jay Baruchel Age, Bio, Wiki, Height, Weight, Career, Relationship</a></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipmp5dqLauu82sZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fraf-simons.html&text=Raf%20Simons-%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fraf-simons.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fraf-simons.html&title=Raf%20Simons-%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fraf-simons.html&title=Raf%20Simons-%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fraf-simons.html&title=Raf%20Simons-%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fraf-simons.html&description=Raf%20Simons-%20Age%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ramiele-malubay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ramiele Malubay Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./princeseveryday-is-a-winding-road-lyrics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PrincesEveryday Is A Winding Road Lyrics">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
