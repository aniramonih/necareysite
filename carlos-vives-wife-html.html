But don't get it twisted, it wasn't Vives that fell in love on their first encounter.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Vives told the outlet that he thought she had already fallen in love with him the first time they came face to face. Apparently, she even told him as much right then and there without even thinking twice.&nbsp;</p><p>His loving spouse cordially confirmed his hypothesis when she was posed with the same question.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She recalled how she heard Vives' album&nbsp;Clásicos de La Provincia when she was in the first semester of Chemical Engineering. A schoolmate had played it for her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I thought it was amazing. I’d always liked Vallenato, but to hear Carlos’ interpretation in this album, was absolutely revolutionary," she added.&nbsp;</p><h2>Carlos Vives and His Wife Wouldn't Change a Thing</h2><p>However, she would not meet her soulmate for a few more years. She first met Vives after she'd been crowned Miss Columbia. The two of them were on the same flight to Miami. They did not interact much, if at all, at the time, and she would only see her spouse-to-be five years later at a TV station she was working in.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"I never imagined we would have a relationship after that meeting," she admitted,&nbsp;"A few days later he asked for my phone number and called me."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They would then go on to talk every night, develop a friendship, and eventually fall in love. Vives admitted that he felt butterflies in his stomach when he saw her at the TV station.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As for his beautiful wife, she felt the same butterflies six months later when they met to head out to shoot 'Déjame Entrar,' his album's first single.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>When asked if they wanted to go back 20 years and change a couple of things about their relationship, they unanimously replied, "No!" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Their First Date Was a Disaster</h2><p>During another appearance, this one on&nbsp;Caracol Televisión’s morning program, Día a Día, the Columbian singer and his wife <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">relived their first date</a>, which was a bike ride they took together.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Admittedly, the former Miss Columbia wasn't much of a rider, but she took up his invitation anyway because she was so excited to see him. In her defense, she did not expect the singer to take her out on such a technical road with so many ups and downs.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Sadly, the date resulted in <a href=# rel=follow>a&nbsp;motorcycle accident</a> where&nbsp;Vásquez suffered a fracture and was immediately transferred to a medical center. Despite the unexpected and unfortunate turn of events,&nbsp; the couple acknowledged that it allowed them to spend the recovery time together.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Vives did not leave her side for the entirety of her recovery, and so they bonded so very well that they have been inseparable since.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuRp7mwv4yvoK%2Bdo2LEqrLEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcarlos-vives-wife-html.html&text=Colombian%20Singer%20Carlos%20Vives%20and%20His%20Wife%20Claudia%20Elena%20Vsquez%20Open%20Up%20about%20Their%2020%20Year%20Long%20R&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcarlos-vives-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcarlos-vives-wife-html.html&title=Colombian%20Singer%20Carlos%20Vives%20and%20His%20Wife%20Claudia%20Elena%20Vsquez%20Open%20Up%20about%20Their%2020%20Year%20Long%20R" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcarlos-vives-wife-html.html&title=Colombian%20Singer%20Carlos%20Vives%20and%20His%20Wife%20Claudia%20Elena%20Vsquez%20Open%20Up%20about%20Their%2020%20Year%20Long%20R" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcarlos-vives-wife-html.html&title=Colombian%20Singer%20Carlos%20Vives%20and%20His%20Wife%20Claudia%20Elena%20Vsquez%20Open%20Up%20about%20Their%2020%20Year%20Long%20R" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcarlos-vives-wife-html.html&description=Colombian%20Singer%20Carlos%20Vives%20and%20His%20Wife%20Claudia%20Elena%20Vsquez%20Open%20Up%20about%20Their%2020%20Year%20Long%20R" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./days-of-our-lives-alum-tyler-christopher-dead-at-age-50.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Days of Our Lives Alum Tyler Christopher Dead at Age 50">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./colin-kaepernicks-parents-truly-shocked-by-the-racist-hatred-from-protest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Colin Kaepernicks Parents Truly Shocked by the Racist Hatred from Protest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
