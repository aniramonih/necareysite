He was given the nickname “Ozzy” in primary school and had struggled with dyslexia. He was also a victim of sexual abuse from school bullies.</p><p>As a teenager, Osbourne dropped out of school and worked several jobs, including construction site laborer, trainee plumber, apprentice toolmaker, and car factory horn-tuner. He also had a run-in with the law and served time in prison for burglary.</p><p>Despite his difficulties, Osbourne was drawn to the stage and participated in school plays. He was a fan of the Beatles and credits their song “She Loves You” for inspiring him to become a musician. Throughout his adult life, Osbourne has struggled with substance abuse, particularly alcohol and drugs.</p><p>He admits to using these substances and has at times faced friction with his band members because of his substance misuse. Osbourne claims to have taken LSD every day for two years while in Black Sabbath and has had problems with cocaine and alcohol. His substance abuse has caused cancellations of shows and affected his performance.</p><p>In 1981, Osbourne had a memorable encounter with a record executive in Germany where he was intoxicated and performed a striptease and kissed the executive on the lips. According to his wife Sharon, he had actually performed a goose-step up and down the table and urinated in the executive’s wine, but was too drunk to remember.</p><p>Ozzy Osbourne, a legendary rock musician, has been frequently accused by religious groups of having a negative impact on teenagers through his music that they say glorifies Satanism. However, these accusations are similar to those faced by the infamous occultist Aleister Crowley.</p><p>Both individuals were wrongly portrayed as evil by the media and certain religious organizations. Despite his song “Mr. Crowley,” Osbourne has stated that he is not a Satanist. In fact, reports indicate that he is a member of the Church of England and prays before each of his concerts.</p><p>In 1981, during a meeting with CBS Records executives in Los Angeles, Osbourne made headlines for biting the head off a dove. He had planned to release the doves as a symbol of peace, but due to his inebriated state, he instead grabbed one and bit its head off.</p><p>This act of animal cruelty, which resulted in blood dripping from his lips, sparked controversy and has been frequently parodied and referenced in his career. Despite this, Osbourne remains a legendary figure in the rock music industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ozzy Osbourne Children: Meet Ozzy Osbourne’s 6 Children</h2><p>Ozzy Osbourne met his first wife, Thelma Riley, in 1971 while she was working at the Rum Runner nightclub in Birmingham. The two got married later that year and had two children, Jessica and Louis. However, the marriage was not successful due to Osbourne’s drug and alcohol abuse and constant absences while touring with Black Sabbath. This took a toll on his family life and his children later expressed that he was not a good father. In the documentary film God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, produced by his son Jack, Osbourne confessed that he could not even remember the birthdates of his children.</p><p>In 1982, Osbourne married his manager Sharon Arden and the couple had three children together, Aimee, Kelly, and Jack. Osbourne chose to get married on July 4th, the American Independence Day, so that he wouldn’t forget his anniversary. The guitarist Randy Rhoads had predicted that the couple would eventually get married, despite their constant arguments and Osbourne still being married to Thelma at the time. The couple has been married for over 40 years now and continues to support each other through thick and thin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqixs7FdpMCju9SrpZ5lk522rbDRnqVmp6qvxm670pumrqqemsBugoycn6KklKeyr3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fozzy-osbourne-children-ozzy-osbournes-6-children.html&text=Ozzy%20Osbourne%20Children%3a%20Meet%20Ozzy%20Osbournes%206%20Children&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fozzy-osbourne-children-ozzy-osbournes-6-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fozzy-osbourne-children-ozzy-osbournes-6-children.html&title=Ozzy%20Osbourne%20Children%3a%20Meet%20Ozzy%20Osbournes%206%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fozzy-osbourne-children-ozzy-osbournes-6-children.html&title=Ozzy%20Osbourne%20Children%3a%20Meet%20Ozzy%20Osbournes%206%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fozzy-osbourne-children-ozzy-osbournes-6-children.html&title=Ozzy%20Osbourne%20Children%3a%20Meet%20Ozzy%20Osbournes%206%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fozzy-osbourne-children-ozzy-osbournes-6-children.html&description=Ozzy%20Osbourne%20Children%3a%20Meet%20Ozzy%20Osbournes%206%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./papa-jim-passed-away-but-what-was-his-death-cause-danny-duncan-and-several-other-friends-send-condolences-297314-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Papa Jim Passed Away But What Was His Death Cause?
