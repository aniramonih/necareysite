They have already begun their family by adopting two children, Caiden and Samuel.</p><p>As a former professional basketball player who became a coach after sustaining a gruesome injury, Brenda also has ties to the game. As a result of an injury sustained during her college years, she was unable to play basketball in her professional career. However, she found a way to be involved with the sport by becoming a coach. She made her official coaching debut in 2003 with the San Francis College Terriers basketball team.</p><p>Hammon, on the other hand, played professional basketball for thirteen years and has been a coach for nearly eight years. She played for the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBASan )’s Antonio Stars and New York Liberty, as well as several teams outside the United States. After becoming a naturalized Russian citizen in 2008, she competed for the Russian national team in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Becky-Hammon-300x293.jpg><h2 id=meet-becky-hammons-lgbtq-partner-brenda-milano><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Becky_Hammon%E2%80%99s_LGBTQ_Partner_Brenda_Milano></span>Meet Becky Hammon’s LGBTQ Partner Brenda Milano<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Becky is currently in a relationship with Brenda Milano, and they are content with their four-person family. According to reports, they have been together since 2015. They have not discussed their first encounter.</p><p>During her college years, Brenda also competed professionally in basketball and was at the top of her league. She could have continued to play basketball after college, but a serious injury prevented her from doing so. She discovered, however, that she could still participate in the game from the sidelines. She became a coach in 2003 and remained in that position until 2012.</p><p>She was born in the United States of America and lived there for the majority of her life. She played basketball for Wagner College in Staten Island, New York, as a student. She is the type of individual who rarely discusses her personal life. She has kept things secret and kept private information confidential.</p><p>Milano concluded her high school athletic career as one of the most remarkable athletes ever to step foot on a school court. She has been a member of the team for four years and has contributed to 48 victories. She received numerous awards, leaving her legacy in gold. In addition to receiving multiple awards for her exceptional performance, she was also honored with numerous accolades. First-Team All-NEC, Preseason MVP Among them are All-NEC First Team, All-NEC Second Team, NEC Rookie of the Week, and All-NEC Newcomer Team.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cayden_and_Samuel_are_Becky_Hammon_and_Milano%E2%80%99s_two_adopted_children></span>Cayden and Samuel are Becky Hammon and Milano’s two adopted children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Becky and Brenda’s two sons, Caiden and Samuel, make up their adorable family of four. Her older son is approximately five years old, while her younger son is barely two years old.</p><p>The basketball coach has done everything possible to raise her children and to provide them with the best life possible. She encourages them and enjoys giving. Hammon never fails to make her children smile when she spends time with them and joins in their enjoyable activities.</p><p>On their mother’s Instagram feed, both brothers are seen playing together. Her Instagram contains stunning images and videos of Caiden and Samuel.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Becky Hammon (@officialbeckyhammon)</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Becky_Hammon%E2%80%99s_Parents_And_Early_Life_Prior_To_WNBA_Stardom></span>Becky Hammon’s Parents And Early Life Prior To WNBA Stardom<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Becky was born to Bev and Martin Hammon on March 11, 1977 as their second child. In a four-person family in Rapid City, South Dakota, she and her older brother were raised. Hammon honed her shooting skills as a young child by playing Nerf basketball at home with her father and older brother.</p><p>Becky played basketball at Stevens High School and earned the title of South Dakota Miss Basketball for her outstanding performance. During her senior year, she was named South Dakota Player of the Year after averaging 26 points, four rebounds, and five steals per game.</p><p>The basketball coach graduated in 1995, and in the same year, her classmates voted her the best female athlete in her graduating class. Becky’s life goal has always been to play basketball, and her family has always supported and encouraged her.</p><p>College basketball recruiters were uninterested in her despite her success because they believed she was too slow and small. She eventually drew the attention of a Colorado State assistant coach, who persuaded her to join the Rams. After that, there was no stopping Becky as she ascended to become one of the greatest WNBA players ever.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Becky_Hammon%E2%80%99s_Basketball_Playing_And_Coaching_Career></span>Becky Hammon’s Basketball Playing And Coaching Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Becky is regarded as one of the most accomplished WNBA players of all time. She had an impact on the game as a player and as a coach. She was fortunate to represent two different countries in international competitions. Hammon was selected for the 1998 William Jones Cup team that competed in Taipei, Taiwan. The American team led by Nell Fortner won all five games to earn the competition’s gold medal.</p><p>In a total of five games, Hammon scored 18 points. She joined the Russian national team as a representative in the 2008 Olympics because the United States team did not invite her back. Hammon was 0 for 6 from the field in the 2008 Olympic Semifinals against the United States, but his 22 points against China helped the Russian team win the bronze medal. She represented Russia in 2009 at EuroBasket, 2010 at the World Championship, and 2012 at the Olympics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Basketball-Player-Becky-Hammon-300x292.jpg><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Becky_Hammon%E2%80%99s_WNBA_Career></span>Becky Hammon’s WNBA Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On May 12, 1999, Hammon was signed by the New York Liberty after being admitted to the WNBA and going undrafted during her first season. During her rookie year, she was Teresa Weatherspoon’s backup point guard, and she posted impressive statistics. Due to her dominating performance on both ends of the court, she gained popularity among supporters of the Liberty.</p><p>Hammon had a breakthrough WNBA season in 2003. He was primarily accustomed to scoring for the Liberty off the bench. However, an injury to her anterior cruciate ligament forced her to end her season prematurely. After the 2003 season, Hammon replaced Weatherspoon as the primary point guard for the Liberty. Hammon joined the Colorado Chill of the NWBL in 2004, but she was limited to just two games due to an injury sustained in 2003.</p><p>On August 16, 2005, Hammon reached 2,000 career points in the WNBA. She was elected a co-captain of the team in 2004, alongside Vickie Johnson and Crystal Robinson. At the conclusion of the 2005 WNBA season, she was selected to the All-WNBA Second Team. During her WNBA offseason in January 2007, she played in the Spanish League with Rivas Futura.</p><p>Hammon was traded to the WNBA’s San Antonio Silver Stars on April 4, 2007. Hammon recruited Big Shot Becky in San Antonio due to her propensity to make shots in crucial situations. That season, she had the most assists in the league. During the 2007 season, Hammon recorded his best averages of 18.8 points per game and 5.0 APG.</p><p>In 2008, Hammon led the Silver Stars to a WNBA-best 24-10 record and a second consecutive appearance in the playoffs, averaging 17.6 points per game and 4.9 assists per game. Hammon scored 30 points in Game 1 of the conference semifinal victory over the Sacramento Monarchs. San Antonio would ultimately win the series and advance to the Western Conference Finals.</p><p>During the 2009 WNBA season, Hammon averaged a career-high 19.5 points per game and 5.0 assists per game. In the opening round, the eventual champion Phoenix Mercury defeated the 15-19 Silver Stars. Hammon was named to the All-WNBA First Team and was also an All-Star. Hammon surpassed 5,000 points in the WNBA on August 31, 2011, becoming the seventh player to do so. Hammon retired from the WNBA in 2014, having been named a WNBA All-Star six times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WNBA-Player-Becky-Hammon-296x300.jpg><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Becky_Hammon%E2%80%99s_Basketball_Coaching_Career></span>Becky Hammon’s Basketball Coaching Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Hammon has long desired to become a coach after her playing career concludes. She participated in workouts, coaches’ meetings, and games with the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association. During her one-year recovery, she was frequently consulted for her opinion.</p><p>Later, on August 5, 2014, the Spurs hired Hammon as an assistant coach, making her the second female coach in league history. Gregg Popovich, the team’s head coach, was thrilled with Hammon’s contribution. During the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, Hammon was the first woman to serve on the All-Star coaching staff.</p><p>On June 2, 2017, Hammon interviewed for the general manager position with the Milwaukee Bucks; however, she was not chosen as a finalist. Gregg Popovich was ejected during the second quarter of the Spurs’ 121-107 loss to the Lakers in Hammon’s sixth season with the team. As a result, Hammon became the first female interim head coach in NBA history. In December 2021, the Las Vegas Aces hired Hammon as their head coach, making her the first Russian head coach in the history of the WNBA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMHRq5ynrF2Ws6etyKuqZ6einHyqv4yfpqullad6o63SpJytmpGhuaa%2BjJucnKOpYrWiucyopWalkae%2FqrHDaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-former-basketballer-becky-hammon-married.html&text=Is%20Former%20Basketballer%20Becky%20Hammon%20Married%3f%20Meet%20Las%20Vegas%20Aces%20Coach%202%20Adopted%20Kids&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-former-basketballer-becky-hammon-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-former-basketballer-becky-hammon-married.html&title=Is%20Former%20Basketballer%20Becky%20Hammon%20Married%3f%20Meet%20Las%20Vegas%20Aces%20Coach%202%20Adopted%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-former-basketballer-becky-hammon-married.html&title=Is%20Former%20Basketballer%20Becky%20Hammon%20Married%3f%20Meet%20Las%20Vegas%20Aces%20Coach%202%20Adopted%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-former-basketballer-becky-hammon-married.html&title=Is%20Former%20Basketballer%20Becky%20Hammon%20Married%3f%20Meet%20Las%20Vegas%20Aces%20Coach%202%20Adopted%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-former-basketballer-becky-hammon-married.html&description=Is%20Former%20Basketballer%20Becky%20Hammon%20Married%3f%20Meet%20Las%20Vegas%20Aces%20Coach%202%20Adopted%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-garner-emotional-end-of-era-in-family-rare-personal-message-children-ex-ben-affleck.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Garner issues emotional message about her children as family embark on new chapter">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-curtis-samuel-any-good-what-is-curtis-samuel-40-yard-dash-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Curtis Samuel any good?
