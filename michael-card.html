His start as a professional musician began when his professor and mentor, William L. Lane, asked him to write some music to accompany weekly sermons at their church. Card’s friend and fellow musician, Randy Scruggs, then requested that he record a demo tape to assist Scruggs to get a job as a producer.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The record label consented to hire Scruggs as long as his first project featured Card. Since then, Card has released thirty-two original albums and six compilation albums. His project, Starkindler, is composed of Card’s interpretations of traditional Celtic hymns. The compilations often include one or two new songs along with previously released material. Card writes a vast majority of the music he records with the exception of Starkiller.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>El Shaddai is his most famous, which was also recorded by Amy Grant. Grant’s recording was named No. 326 on the RIAA’s list of 365 Songs of the Century in 2001. Other popular Card songs include Immanuel, Joy in the Journey, and Heal Our Land. Heal Our Land was commissioned as the 1993 National Day of Prayer’s theme song.</p><p>Despite his success in music, he has always maintained that his music career is secondary to his calling as a Bible teacher. He has distanced himself from the CCM industry by criticizing the promotion of personalities over musical content and the shifting emphasis away from God in order to sell more albums.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Michael Card Author</h2><p>Card has authored and co-authored twenty-two books. He originally started writing as a way to share the knowledge he accumulated while researching his songs. He found his studies were too in-depth to condense everything he had learned into one short piece. The books that resulted from album research bear the same titles as the albums.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><p>He then branched out to other subjects not specifically based on his music, such as the Gospel of John, homeschooling, and Christian discipleship and mentoring. In 2014, Card completed the Biblical Imagination Series, a four-volume set that takes a deeper look at each of the gospels and the voice of the writers behind them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>Michael Card Radio host</h2><p>Besides touring and writing, he also hosted a weekly radio program, In the Studio with Michael Card. It was carried by stations in 48 states, Canada, and the Caribbean. It was also available through Internet streaming audio and as a podcast. The show was an amalgam of talk, musical performances, and Bible study. The show ceased production in March 2009 but was then revived on June 18, 2018, with a mix of completely new and classic material.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Michael Card</h2><h3>Who is Michael Card?</h3><p>Card is an American, Christian singer-songwriter, musician, author, and radio host from Franklin, Tennessee.
