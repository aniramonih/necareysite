His parents divorced when he was just two years old, leading to a fragmented childhood. He found solace with his mother’s relatives in Monroeville, Alabama, where he formed a close bond with his distant cousin, Nanny Rumbley Faulk, whom he fondly called “Sook.” Capote’s love for storytelling emerged early, as he taught himself to read and write before even starting school.
