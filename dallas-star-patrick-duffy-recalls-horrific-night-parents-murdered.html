In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Closer Weekly</a>, the former CBS primetime soap opera star said though he went through the motions he always felt close to his parents.&nbsp;</p><p>"When my parents were murdered, I went through all the emotions of the horrific event — shock and anger and everything — but I never felt disconnected from [my parents]. I never felt that immediate loss,” Duffy said, “I did not know why then, but in retrospect, it was a result of being Buddhist.”</p><p>On November 18, 1986, his parents were killed by two men named Kenneth Miller and Sean Wentz during an armed robbery in Boulder Montana. His parents were owners of a bar called The Lodge and he described them as "pretty ordinary, pleasant people" who were "very social". The killers were convicted and sentenced to prison time with Wentz to serve 180 years in prison and Miller being granted parole in 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e15855c4-507e-41e0-bb48-0f8fd1c30644.jpg><p>"My father kicked these two young men out of the bar at some point in the evening. So they went and drank elsewhere…and came back to the bar to kick his ass,” Duffy recalled in the interview,&nbsp; "When they stepped in the bar with their guns, they shot him. There was nobody else in the bar, so they shot both my mother and my father."</p><p>After his parent's death, he leaned on his wife Carlyn Rosser. But when Rosser passed suddenly in 2017, his boys were his rock. "My boys were there as stalwarts. But I also realized that, as much as they were trying to buttress old dad up, I'm probably more adjusted to this set of circumstances than they are. You reach a certain age and you realize the road ahead is much shorter than the road behind," he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/2ade303e-7051-42e7-ab14-9fa2115497e3.jpg><p>He was married for 43 years, but even after her death, he considers himself taken. "I can hear her. I can see her. I know what she would expect of me, and I try and live up to that. I still consider myself a married man."&nbsp;</p><p>Wentz is still serving time for the murder. I’m OK with that,” he said speaking about the two men, who were teenagers at the time of the crime.&nbsp; "My point of view is he’s already been punished. You know, whether he’s in prison or out of prison," he said. He's still acting to keep himself busy. He is playing a small-screen role on Lifetime TV movie 'Random Acts of Christmas', coming to TV on November 17.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonJGhuaK%2FjKyrmqpdpa61vsicomacpZuzunnRnpqapJyoeqm70augn6GTYruqs8etZKmZopq7tb%2BMpqyrnJWnsqU%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdallas-star-patrick-duffy-recalls-horrific-night-parents-murdered.html&text=%27Dallas%27%20star%20Patrick%20Duffy%20recalls%20horrific%20night%20two%20drunk%20teens%20killed%20his%20parents%20during%20armed%20r&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdallas-star-patrick-duffy-recalls-horrific-night-parents-murdered.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdallas-star-patrick-duffy-recalls-horrific-night-parents-murdered.html&title=%27Dallas%27%20star%20Patrick%20Duffy%20recalls%20horrific%20night%20two%20drunk%20teens%20killed%20his%20parents%20during%20armed%20r" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdallas-star-patrick-duffy-recalls-horrific-night-parents-murdered.html&title=%27Dallas%27%20star%20Patrick%20Duffy%20recalls%20horrific%20night%20two%20drunk%20teens%20killed%20his%20parents%20during%20armed%20r" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdallas-star-patrick-duffy-recalls-horrific-night-parents-murdered.html&title=%27Dallas%27%20star%20Patrick%20Duffy%20recalls%20horrific%20night%20two%20drunk%20teens%20killed%20his%20parents%20during%20armed%20r" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdallas-star-patrick-duffy-recalls-horrific-night-parents-murdered.html&description=%27Dallas%27%20star%20Patrick%20Duffy%20recalls%20horrific%20night%20two%20drunk%20teens%20killed%20his%20parents%20during%20armed%20r" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./yellowstone-season-5-everything-to-know-so-far.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Yellowstone' Season 5: Everything to Know So Far">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./black-mafia-family-bmf-episode-2-starz-50-cent-davinchi-lil-meech-lamar-goes-crazy-fans-react.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Black Mafia Family' Episode 2: Lamar is killing people, shocked fans say he's 'loco'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
