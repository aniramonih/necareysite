Jamie was like waiting for such a signal because he took up the opportunity with both hands. It was a chance for him to showcase his business and the industry in general.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-6673 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jamie-Davis-profession.jpg alt="Image of Jamie Davis from Highway Thru Hell show" width=600 height=445 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>On September 4th, 2012 “<a href=#>Highway Thru Hell</a>” was aired for the first time on Discovery Channel Canada.
