But it’s not just his skill that has made him memorable.&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Block’s wife, Val Block, has been by his side every step of the way, offering unwavering support and encouragement.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, the Blocks have become a dynamic duo that fans can’t help but root for. As the competition heats up, all eyes are on Michael Block and his impressive performance.</p><p>Michael Block’s triumphant victory at the 2023 PGA Championship was undoubtedly the weekend’s headline, but he wasn’t the only one leaving Oak Hill with something to celebrate.&nbsp;</p><p>Block, a PGA club pro, stood out as one of the most inspiring stories in golf history. His consistent performance throughout the four days earned him a spot in the 15th position.&nbsp;</p><p>On Sunday, Block’s dramatic performance included a hole-in-one on the 15th hole and a challenging par save on the 18th, sealing his automatic invite to the tournament next year.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after the tournament, Block received yet another invitation to the upcoming PGA Tour event. Block’s extraordinary achievements in the sport are making waves, and for this humble club pro, this weekend will always be a historic one.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Val Block?</h2><p>Val Block, originally from Argentina, is a resident of Mission Viejo, California. Although she leads a private life.</p><p>Despite not being actively involved in the golfing world, Val enjoys watching her husband play.&nbsp;</p><p>Her personal golfing skills have been described as less-than-stellar, even by her husband who she admits doesn’t have the patience to teach her.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, she is a supportive spouse and takes pleasure in witnessing her husband’s success on the course.&nbsp;</p><p>With Val’s Support, it’s no wonder Block is continuing to thrive as a professional golfer in California.</p><p>Michael’s wife, Val, praised his tireless dedication, saying, “<strong>he worked so hard for this.” </strong>Val’s passion for her husband’s success was evident when she admitted that her heart was “beating out of [her] chest” the night before Michael’s game-changing performance.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Block and Val Block’s relationship history explored&nbsp;</h2><p>Michael Block crossed paths with his future wife, Val, at a birthday party in Laguna Beach, California.&nbsp;</p><p>Their chemistry was palpable from the beginning and they soon embarked on a fulfilling relationship, which has now spanned over 18 years. Although it is not clear when they got married, the couple has since shared many cherished moments together.</p><p>Val has fond memories of their first encounter, as she reminisced about the night they met saying,<strong> “I went back to Argentina, but then 20 days later, I came back and that was it. I was wearing a sash and he just grabbed me by the sash.”</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This distinctive moment marked the beginning of their love story, which has since blossomed into a beautiful family.</p><p>Val and Michael have two children together, Dylan, aged 18, and Ethan, aged 16. Similar to their father, both sons harbor a deep love for golf, with Dylan even making it to the prestigious sectionals of the U.S. Open.&nbsp;</p><p>Val spoke highly of Michael’s role as a father, stating that <strong>“He just supports his kids more than anything.”</strong>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Block’s Family</h2><p>Michael Block, the American professional golfer and golf instructor, leads a fascinating life inside and out of the golf course.&nbsp;</p><p>While his career has been widely talked about, his personal life is equally interesting.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s dive into a closer look at Michael Block’s children.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Meet Dylan Block</h3><p>Dylan, aged 18, is Michael Block’s eldest son. Not much is known about him as he prefers to keep his life private.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we do know that Dylan has followed in his father’s footsteps and is also interested in golf. With a father who is a pro golfer, it is no surprise that Dylan has grown up with golf as an important part of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>We can expect to see more of him in the future as he continues to pursue his passion for golf.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Meet Ethan Block</h3><p>Ethan, aged 16, is Michael Block’s youngest son. Unlike his older brother, Ethan is not interested in golf.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, Ethan has a passion for music. According to Michael, Ethan plays the drums and is quite good at it.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview, Michael said that Ethan has even performed in his school’s band. It is great to know that Michael Block’s children are pursuing their passions and excelling in their respective fields.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Block’s Family Life</h2><p>Throughout their marriage, the couple has maintained a low profile, and their love story remains one of the most endearing aspects of Michael’s personal life.</p><p>While there is no information about Michael’s siblings, it is evident that his family is an integral part of his life. Michael Block has successfully balanced his personal life with his career and is an exemplary role model for his children.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Block’s Net Worth and Social Media Presence</h2><p>Michael Block had an estimated net worth of $18 million as of May 2023.
