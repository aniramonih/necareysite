While in elementary school, he played for Three Milne Boys Home, which is now known as New Orleans Recreation Development Commission.</span></p><p><span>Kelly started playing high school basketball in his junior year at George Bush High School and later went on to play at Findlay Prep in his senior year. He was selected on the Parade All-American First Team and the USA TODAY’s All-USA First Team while in high school.</span></p><p><span>Kelly got into the University of Kansas and played for the Kansas Jayhawks. He played 36 games at Kansas, where he was one of the best players on the team and the entire season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#><strong>Gerald Henderson Sr.</strong> is a former American NBA player but is still remembered on the court for his excellent game mastery and techniques.

He has suffered from knee injuries, wrist injuries, a foot injury, a groin injury, and some concussions.</span></p><p><span>However, he suffered two knee injuries at different times, which were fairly serious.

Kelly mentioned in an interview that he remembers sitting in traffic for about eight hours during the evacuation process. The family drove to Houston that night.</span></p><p><span>Later, the family checked on their old house and found out that the flooding never touched it. However, Oubre’s father decided to stay in Houston to provide Kelly with a better environment to grow and develop.</span></p><h2><span>Kelly Oubre Jr. | </span><span>Relationships:</span></h2><p><span>The basketball star is currently dating Shylyn.
