Among his most notable releases during this period was "Bubalú", a new collaboration with producers DJ Luian and Mambo Kingz featuring Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA and American singer Becky G. The single was released on November 6, 2018 and became a Top 30 hit on the Hot Latin Songs chart in the US.</p><p>Five was released as Royce&amp;apos;s fifth studio album on February 24, 2017. It became Royce&amp;apos;s fourth number-one album on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. The album&amp;apos;s last single, "Déjà Vu", with Shakira, became its most successful commercially and was certified 9x Platinum (Latin) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the US.</p><p>On January 29, 2016, the single "Solo Yo" was released as a vocal duet credited to Mexican singer Sofía Reyes and Royce. At the Premios Lo Nuestro 2017 awards ceremony, the song received a nomination for Pop Song of the Year. On March 11, 2016, "Nobody But Me", an English version of "Solo Yo", was also released as a single. On March 20, 2016, Royce starred as Saint Peter in the Fox Broadcasting Company live musical production of the Biblical story The Passion. Also in 2016, he had a recurring role as dancing coach Vincent on the fourth season of Hulu&amp;apos;s teen drama series East Los High. In July 2016, Royce embarked on a North American concert tour with Pitbull, titled The Bad Man Tour. Also that July, Royce became one of approximately 27 artists to lend their voices to "Hands", a charity single recorded as a tribute to victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting. All of the song&amp;apos;s proceeds benefited the families affected during the shooting, and helped cover medical costs and counseling efforts.</p><p>He is an actor, known for Furious 7 (2015), The Passion (2016) and Prince Royce: Corazón Sin Cara, Version 2 (2010).</p><p>In April 2014, Royce and Brazilian musician Michel Teló recorded a Portuguese-language version of "Darte un Beso" under the title "Te Dar um Beijo". On November 24, 2014, Royce released "Stuck on a Feeling" featuring Snoop Dogg as the first single from his fourth studio album, Double Vision. The single is Royce&amp;apos;s best-performing single in the United States to date, having reached number forty-three on the Billboard Hot 100. In early 2015, he contributed the song "My Angel" to the soundtrack album for the blockbuster film Furious 7 (2015). On March 24, 2015, Royce released "Qué Cosas Tiene el Amor", a co-lead single with Dominican Republic singer <a href=#>Anthony Santos</a>. In March 2015, it was announced that Royce would join Ariana Grande&amp;apos;s The Honeymoon Tour as the opening act for 40 dates in the United States. Royce&amp;apos;s first album primarily in the English language, Double Vision was released on July 24, 2015, preceded by the album&amp;apos;s second single, "Back It Up" featuring Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull, which was released in May 2015. The single reached number ten on the US Latin Pop Songs chart and number ninety-two on the Billboard Hot 100. The Spanish-language version of the song was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Song, making Royce an eight-time Latin Grammy-nominated performer.</p><p>His third studio album, Soy el Mismo, was released on October 8, 2013, preceded by the single "Darte un Beso". The album earned Royce his second nomination for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Tropical Album. On July 24, 2015, Royce released his fourth studio album, Double Vision, his first primarily in the English language. The album included the singles "Stuck on a Feeling" featuring Snoop Dogg and "Back It Up" featuring Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull, with both charting on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>In March 2010, Royce released his eponymous debut studio album, which generated two commercially successful singles, "Stand by Me" and "Corazón Sin Cara". In the United States, both songs reached number-one on the Billboard Tropical Songs chart, while "Corazón Sin Cara" reached number-one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. The album itself reached number-one on the US Billboard Top Latin Albums and Tropical Albums charts. Royce received three awards at the Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2011, which included Tropical Album of the Year. On April 10, 2012, Royce released his second studio album, Phase II, which reached number-one on both the US Latin Albums and Tropical Albums charts. The album featured the singles "Las Cosas Pequeñas" and "Incondicional" and was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Tropical Fusion Album.</p><p>The album earned Royce a nomination for Best Contemporary Tropical Album at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2011. At the awards ceremony, Royce performed "Stand by Me" alongside the song&amp;apos;s original performer <a href=#>Ben E. King</a>. At the 2011 Premio Lo Nuestro Awards, Royce won three awards in the Tropical genre, including Male Artist of the Year, New Soloist or Group of the Year, and Song of the Year for "Stand by Me". Royce was also nominated for six awards at the 2011 Latin Billboard Music Awards. Ultimately, he won three of them: Tropical Airplay Solo Artist of the Year, Tropical Album of the Year for Prince Royce, and Tropical Albums Solo Artist of the Year. In April 2011, Royce collaborated with Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee on the song "Ven Conmigo", which was included on the latter&amp;apos;s album, Prestige (2012). The song became Royce&amp;apos;s third top-ten hit in the US Hot Latin Songs chart, peaking at number nine. In May 2011, Royce signed with Atlantic Records to release English-language albums in a joint partnership with the Top Stop Music label. Royce then began working on his second studio album, which was said to be mostly in English with Latin music influences. That same month, Spanish pop star Enrique Iglesias announced that Royce and American rapper Pitbull would be joining him as special guests during a concert leg of his Euphoria Tour, which began in mid-September 2011. Then, in October, Mexican rock band Maná remixed their single "El Verdadero Amor Perdona" into a bachata version with Royce as a featured artist. The song, from the deluxe edition of the band&amp;apos;s album Drama y Luz (2011), topped the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in late 2011, becoming Royce&amp;apos;s second number-one single on the ranking.</p><p>Royce released his eponymous debut studio album on March 2, 2010. The album was produced primarily by Hidalgo and <a href=#>Sergio George</a>, with co-production duties by Royce. AllMusic&amp;apos;s Jason Birchmeier credited Hidalgo for the "crisp production job, which is often spare but adds touches of urban beats here and there." Shortly after its release, the album debuted on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart at number fifteen. The lead single from the album, "Stand by Me" (a cover of Ben E. King&amp;apos;s 1961 song) peaked at number-one on the US Billboard Tropical Songs chart, and also reached number eight on the US Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. The album&amp;apos;s second single, "Corazón Sin Cara", was released in February 2010 and peaked at number-one on both the US Hot Latin Songs and Tropical Songs charts. The album itself eventually reached number-one on the US Billboard Latin Albums chart and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In December 2010, Royce recorded a song with <a href=#>Sergio George</a> called "El Campo de los Sueños", which was used as the theme song for the television program Domingo de Grandes Ligas on American TV sports network ESPN in its 2010 season.</p><p>At age fifteen, Royce had begun making music with a partner named José Chusán, better known as "Jino". The duo was also known as "Jino and Royce, El Dúo Real". At the age of sixteen, Royce adopted the stage name "Prince Royce" and started making music with longtime friend and record producer Donzell Rodríguez, and Vincent Outerbridge, known together as "L Snipe & Vinny". The duo eventually had a meeting with Atlantic Records in early 2007. With the decline of reggaeton music in the Latin music industry at the time, Royce made the ultimate decision to focus on making bachata music. At age nineteen, Royce met producer Andrés Hidalgo, who after hearing his demos, instantly became his manager. Hidalgo began helping Royce work hands-on with bachata music. That was the turning point that helped Royce decide that he wanted to pursue a musical career. Hidalgo later introduced Royce to record producer <a href=#>Sergio George</a>, who immediately signed Royce to his label, Top Stop Music, after listening to three of his demos.</p><p>Prince Royce was born on May 11, 1989 in The Bronx, New York City, New York, USA as Geoffrey Royce Rojas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfpb%2BqusKeZKunqZiy</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprince-royce.html&text=Prince%20Royce%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-royce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-royce.html&title=Prince%20Royce%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprince-royce.html&title=Prince%20Royce%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprince-royce.html&title=Prince%20Royce%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-royce.html&description=Prince%20Royce%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jayden-denegal-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="QB Jayden Denegal Parents: Marc Denegal And Kim Maxwell">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./prettygarden-soft-comfy-lightweight-lounge-pants-amazon-fashion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PRETTYGARDEN Soft Lounge Pants Are Even Cozier Than They Look">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
