His towering height has become a topic of curiosity among viewers, and many are eager to know just how tall this reality star is. In this article, we’ll delve into the world of Carl Radke and explore the fascinating dimensions of his height.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Carl Radke’s Return to Summer House</strong></h3><p>As “Summer House” made its return to our screens on January 17th, Carl Radke came back to share his journey with viewers. The previous summer had been a challenging one for him, but he has since embarked on a path to become the best version of himself. One significant decision he made was to quit drinking, and he also revealed that he is officially dating Lindsay Hubbard. However, amidst these revelations, there’s one aspect of Carl that’s hard to ignore: his towering height.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Unveiling Carl’s Impressive Height</strong></h3><p>Carl Radke stands at a remarkable height of 6 feet 5 inches. This towering stature sets him apart from his fellow “Summer House” cast members and has left viewers in awe. But what seems to elevate his height even further is his distinctive hair quiff, which almost brushes against the Summer House ceilings.</p><h3><strong>A Height Above the Rest</strong></h3><p>Carl’s height is not just impressive; it’s well above the average male height in the USA, which is approximately 5 feet 9 inches, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His striking appearance has garnered attention, with some fans playfully expressing their admiration and even proposing humorous marriage requests. It’s clear that Carl’s height has made him stand out in more ways than one.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Carl vs. Kyle: A Height Comparison</strong></h3><p>While Carl Radke’s journey includes personal growth and sobriety, let’s not forget to compare his height to that of his co-star Kyle Cooke. Carl’s newfound sobriety has earned him the admiration and support of fans, but for now, we’ll focus on their physical dimensions.</p><p>Kyle Cooke, another “Summer House” star, falls significantly shorter than Carl, with a height of 5 feet 11 inches. In the past, some viewers speculated that Carl’s height might have been the sole reason for his appeal to women, but his transformation and commitment to sobriety have brought a newfound level of admiration from fans.</p><h3><strong>Fan Reactions to Carl’s Towering Height</strong></h3><p>The premiere episode of “Summer House” Season 6, which aired on January 17th, caused quite a stir among fans, with Carl’s height taking center stage. His tall stature seemed even more pronounced, thanks to his distinctive quiff. A recent photo shared by Carl alongside Kyle Cooke confirmed the stark difference in their heights.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Viewers couldn’t help but question Kyle’s height in comparison. One fan humorously pondered, “Is Kyle even 5 feet tall?” The curiosity about their heights reached a peak when Carl and Kyle appeared on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” on January 17th, where Carl affirmed his impressive height, leading to exclamations of surprise from viewers.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Carl Radke’s towering presence on “Summer House” has undoubtedly left an impression on fans. Standing at 6 feet 5 inches, he rises above the average and stands tall both in the world of reality TV and in his personal journey of growth and recovery. As fans continue to follow his adventures on the show, they can’t help but marvel at the man whose quiff almost kisses the Summer House ceilings, making him a unique and beloved figure in the Bravo universe.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxxhY6cmKukXaeupbfEZqCsZaOkerWty6VkoaGjYr62tcWfZJqknaTAtXnKoqqsnaNiwamxjKyspqWVp3qpu9SsnGablZ65qrrGrGWhrJ2h</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcarl-radke-is-so-tall-his-quiff-almost-kisses-the-summer-house-ceilings-html.html&text=Carl%20Radke%20is%20so%20tall%20his%20quiff%20almost%20kisses%20the%20Summer%20House%20ceilings&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcarl-radke-is-so-tall-his-quiff-almost-kisses-the-summer-house-ceilings-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcarl-radke-is-so-tall-his-quiff-almost-kisses-the-summer-house-ceilings-html.html&title=Carl%20Radke%20is%20so%20tall%20his%20quiff%20almost%20kisses%20the%20Summer%20House%20ceilings" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcarl-radke-is-so-tall-his-quiff-almost-kisses-the-summer-house-ceilings-html.html&title=Carl%20Radke%20is%20so%20tall%20his%20quiff%20almost%20kisses%20the%20Summer%20House%20ceilings" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcarl-radke-is-so-tall-his-quiff-almost-kisses-the-summer-house-ceilings-html.html&title=Carl%20Radke%20is%20so%20tall%20his%20quiff%20almost%20kisses%20the%20Summer%20House%20ceilings" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcarl-radke-is-so-tall-his-quiff-almost-kisses-the-summer-house-ceilings-html.html&description=Carl%20Radke%20is%20so%20tall%20his%20quiff%20almost%20kisses%20the%20Summer%20House%20ceilings" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chris-donah-from-the-curse-of-oak-island-background-career-family-death-and-tribute.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Donah from The Curse of Oak Island: Background, Career, Family, Death and Tribute">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./brisa-romero-missing-police-announce-the-missing-of-carpentersville-teenager-brisa-romero-last-seen-on-monday-night-while-en-route-to-a-holiday-party.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brisa Romero Missing: Police Announce the Missing of Carpentersville Teenager, Brisa Romero, las">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
