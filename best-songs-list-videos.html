"I just sat down at the piano and I started to work on this tune and the lyrics just came right out. I was drunk, that's the truth. I have never written anything sober in my life.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I thought this is a great concept," he explained.

He was initially concerned that listeners would think it was about the Crimea River but that “sitting down and playing the melody and coming up with lyrics made it a nonissue”.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Is it just us, or does Michael's version sound like a Bond song?</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=19><h2 class=title>'Everything'</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/l-wJaLftzAM/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Michael Bublé - Everything at Madison Square Garden [Live]</p><p class=paragraph-text>Michael said of this song: "I wrote that song about the great happiness of real love, but at the same time I was making a statement about the world. We're living in really crazy times, and I wanted to say that no matter what's happening, this person in my life is what really makes it worthwhile."</p><p class=paragraph-text>However, after he broke up with the influence for the song, his ex-girlfriend actress Emily Blunt, he admitted he found it hard to sing live: "I'm OK now. But straight after, well, I didn't want to listen to music. Forget about my music. I couldn't do anything. The only good thing I did do was I went and got a therapist.</p><p class=paragraph-text>“I felt bad for everybody involved. It's definitely worse cause it's all done publicly. You go to the grocery store and it's in every magazine. It's the same thing that's happened in my other break-ups. It's always tough. You grow attached to someone and they become your best friend. You lose a friend – that's one of the most difficult parts. I'm a sentimental person."</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=16><h2 class=title>'Haven't Met You Yet'</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/zS-_wGmn8jk/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Haven't Met You Yet</p><p class=paragraph-text>This was arguably the song that transformed Michael into a worldwide superstar. Before this, he was mainly known for cover versions and hadn't had a huge singles hit. But this song reached the UK top 10 and helped his album Crazy Love become a monster success.</p><p class=paragraph-text>He was inspired by his wife, Argentine actress and model Luisana Lopilato for this, who was his fiancée at the time he wrote it.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"I wrote it because I had met this girl and there was nothing solid about anything of it. She didn't speak English. There was every reason to not try to get into this predicament of a relationship, yet I did and it was weird. The song came from that – it was inspired by meeting her.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"You live on your potential as a single person – it keeps you sane. I'm not saying that you can't be alone and be happy but there's this great way to keep your sanity where it's like you know it's going to happen – you just haven't met them yet."</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=4><h2 class=title>'Home'</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/lbSOLBMUvIE/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Michael Bublé - Home [Official Music Video]</p><p class=paragraph-text>This was one of Michael's first hits that was an original song rather than a cover version.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Michael wrote this song for his ex-fiancée, Debbie Timuss, about the pain of being away from her while he traveled the world during their relationship of eight years.</p></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaJmiqba0wNJopKKbmJayrXnBrpmlnV%2BXsrTAjKymp5%2BjYrmqv9NmraKclaTAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-songs-list-videos.html&text=Michael%20Bubl%27s%2010%20greatest%20songs%20ever%2c%20ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-songs-list-videos.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-songs-list-videos.html&title=Michael%20Bubl%27s%2010%20greatest%20songs%20ever%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-songs-list-videos.html&title=Michael%20Bubl%27s%2010%20greatest%20songs%20ever%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-songs-list-videos.html&title=Michael%20Bubl%27s%2010%20greatest%20songs%20ever%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-songs-list-videos.html&description=Michael%20Bubl%27s%2010%20greatest%20songs%20ever%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-hyatt-actress-age-height-movies-and-tv-shows-education-young-family-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Hyatt (Actress) Age, Height, Movies and TV Shows, Education, Young, Family, Instagram">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./meet-teyana-taylor-and-iman-shumpert-children-what-we-know-about-them.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Teyana Taylor And Iman Shumpert Children -What We Know About Them The Talks Today">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
