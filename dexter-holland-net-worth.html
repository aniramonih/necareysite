Although he is perhaps best known for being the frontman of the rock band The Offspring, Holland is a man of many talents. Among other things, Dexter is a successful entrepreneur, pilot, and virologist. In 2017, he obtained a Ph.D. in molecular biology.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Bryan Keith "Dexter" Holland was born on December 29th of 1965 in Garden Grove, California. During his school years, he became known as an excellent student, graduating as the valedictorian after displaying a keen interest in mathematics. After graduating from high school, he attended the University of Southern California and obtained a B.S. degree in biology. He then went on to obtain an M.S. degree in molecular biology before the success of The Offspring caused him to focus on music instead of his college education.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Holland's first band was called Manic Subsidal, and it was formed in 1984. He played the drums initially but later switched to vocals and guitars. In 1985, the group changed their name to The Offspring and signed a record deal with Nemesis Records in 1988. Kevin "Noodles" Wasserman was a school janitor when he joined the group, and it is rumored that he was only allowed to join because he was able to buy alcohol for the other members, who were below the legal drinking age. Their first full-length, self-titled album was released in 1989. Later, Holland reissued this debut album with his own record label, Nitro Records.</p><p>In 1991, The Offspring signed a new record deal with Epitaph Records and released another album called "Ignition." They followed up with another album called "Smash," which holds the record for the most sales generated by an album released through an independent label. This was their first taste of commercial success, and the album sold more than 11 million copies worldwide. During this period, Holland and his bandmates were credited with putting the mainstream spotlight back on punk music. "Smash" featured hits like "Come Out and Play," "Self Esteem," "Gotta Get Away."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-163184 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GettyImages-2812985.jpg alt="Dexter Holland Net Worth" width=594 height=397 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-163184 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Winter /</p><p>Getty Images</p><p>The group then signed yet another record deal with Columbia Records and released a slew of albums throughout the late 90s and early 2000s. These included "Ixnay on the Hombre," "Americana," "Conspiracy of One," "Splinter," and "Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace." "Ixnay on the Hombre" failed to reach the same levels of success as "Smash," but it still managed to sell 4 million units with hits like "Gone Away" and "I Choose."</p><p>The Offspring bounced back in 1998 with the release of "Americana." The album included hits like "Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)," "Why Don't You Get a Job," and "The Kids Aren't Alright." This represented the peak of The Offspring's popularity. And commercial success steadily declined over the next few years.</p><p>A number of lineup changes occurred during this period, and only three of the members ever appeared on all of The Offspring's albums. The Offspring still tours occasionally, and Holland is known for occasionally playing the piano during live shows.</p><h2 id=catalog-sale><strong>Catalog Sale</strong></h2><p>In January 2016, Dexter and his band mates sold the rights to The Offspring's catalog to Round Hill Music for $35 million.</p><h2 id=relationships><strong>Relationships</strong></h2><p>Dexter Holland first met hairstylist Kristine Luna in 1992. They subsequently started a relationship, and in 1995 they were married. During this period, Luna appeared in a number of music videos for The Offspring and even co-wrote one of their songs. In 2012, the pair obtained a divorce. Holland then married a woman named Amber Sasse. Dexter has a daughter from a previous relationship named Lex Land. Land is now an established singer-songwriter.</p><h2 id=gringo-bandito-amp-other-ventures><strong>Gringo Bandito & Other Ventures</strong></h2><p>In 2004, Dexter launched a hot sauce brand known as Gringo Bandito. As of this writing, Gringo has sold well over two million bottles and is available in more than 500 restaurants, and 7,000 supermarkets. The bottle's label features Holland wearing a bandit's outfit, complete with bandoliers and revolvers. Dexter is passionate about Mexican food and hot sauce, and he describes it as a "way of life" in California.</p><p>In 1994, Dexter Holland founded Nitro Records along with Greg K, another member of The Offspring. Over the years, the record label became famous for developing punk rock artists, including AFI. The label has also worked with bands such as The Damned and T.S.O.L. In 2013, Nitro Records was acquired by Bicycle Records, and Holland no longer operated the company after that point.</p><p>Holland also has a number of interesting hobbies. As a licensed pilot, Dexter regularly goes on daring flights, including a 10-day solo flight around the entire planet. He is also a registered flight instructor. Other hobbies include surfing and stamp collecting. Dexter is particularly passionate about stamps from the Isle of Man.</p><h2 id=return-university><strong>Return to University</strong></h2><p>Dexter later returned to his studies and became a doctoral student at the Laboratory of Viral Oncology and Proteomics Research at the Keck School of Medicine. In 2013, Holland and a number of co-authors published a paper in "PloS One" on the subject of microRNA in HIV genomes. This paper describes the use of computational molecular biological approaches to identify microRNA sequences in RNA. In recognition of his work, Holland was eventually awarded his Ph.D. degree in molecular biology in 2017</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2020, Dexter Holland listed his property in Huntington Beach for $4.399 million. Located just a few miles away from where the Offspring first got together, the property features tiled and hardwood floors. He originally purchased the residence for $3.86 million in 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aiapGWjqa6zv46dnLGslad6qbvLpZinnF2jsrV51qipraBf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdexter-holland-net-worth.html&text=Dexter%20Holland%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdexter-holland-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdexter-holland-net-worth.html&title=Dexter%20Holland%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdexter-holland-net-worth.html&title=Dexter%20Holland%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdexter-holland-net-worth.html&title=Dexter%20Holland%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdexter-holland-net-worth.html&description=Dexter%20Holland%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./does-harvey-weinstein-have-a-son.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Harvey Weinstein have a son?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./de-la-soul-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="De La Soul Net Worth 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
