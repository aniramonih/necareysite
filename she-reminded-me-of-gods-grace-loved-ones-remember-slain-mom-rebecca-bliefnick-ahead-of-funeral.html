On Wednesday, March 1, police raided the home of slain <a href=#>Rebecca Bliefnick's</a> estranged husband Tim Bliefnick, 39, but he has not been named a suspect in the murder.&nbsp;</p><p>Rebecca's <a href=#>bullet-riddled body</a>&nbsp;was found by a relative on February 23 inside the 41-year-old's home at 2528 Kentucky Road in Quincy, <a href=# rel=nofollow>WGEM</a> reported. The relative went to check on Rebecca after she did not pick up her three children from St Peter School, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Muddy River News</a> reported. Police arrived at the crime scene shortly after and were joined by a member of the Adams County State Attorney’s Office.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Orsolya Gaal murder: Pair of BLOOD-SOAKED BOOTS may help cops identify Queens mom's killer</a></p><p><a href=#>Orsolya Gaal's last moments: Chilling footage shows killer drag body in duffel bag near NYC home</a></p><h2 class=split><strong>'Her boys were her world'</strong></h2><p>Rebecca's <a href=# rel>obituary</a> talks about her professional interests, stating she attended Payson Seymour Elementary School followed by Quincy Notre Dame High School, where she was named valedictorian, which was the " first of many academic and professional honors in her lifetime." "She graduated cum laude from Quincy University with a bachelor’s degree in biological science with a minor in chemistry and worked for Sanofi Aventis as one of their top-performing pharmaceutical sales representatives. But Becky always envisioned herself working hands-on in the medical profession, so it was no surprise when she left pharmaceuticals for a career in nursing—her true calling—where she was able to provide care and comfort to people on a daily basis," <a href=# rel=nofollow>the obituary says</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"In addition to her career, Becky always made time for service. According to members of the St. Peter’s Grade School Association where Becky volunteered for the last five years, Becky was “a tremendous asset” and “always willing to help or pitch in,” whether it was coordinating the Mother/Son event, planning the teacher conference luncheons, or coordinating the school’s room mothers. Her love of animals led her to volunteering at Homeward Bound Waggin, a non-profit, all-volunteer animal rescue group. Becky was also slated to begin volunteering in the spring at QUEST Stables, which focuses on providing therapeutic riding services," it adds.</p><p>The obituary says apart from being dedicated to the professional life, was loved her family. "Her boys were her world, her life’s greatest gifts. She was the quintessential “boy mom,” aptly illustrated by building, for Halloween, Transformers costumes that actually transformed, creating custom “first day of school” posters each year, and jumping all-in with fishing and frog hunting and anything sports. Her Catholic faith was of great importance and she worked diligently to instill her love for God in her boys," it says.&nbsp;</p><p>The obituary says Rebecca will be "cherished" forever by "her parents—Bill and Bernadette Postle; her children—Deacon, Greyson, and Arlin Bliefnick; her sister, brother-in-law, and nieces—Sarah, Bret, Cavan, and Emma Reilly; and her aunts, cousins, and extended family in Chicago, Colorado, and England." It quotes Rebecca as recently saying, "If the past year has reinforced any of my beliefs, it is that of the importance and value of family, and clearly I have the best one.”</p><h2 class=split><strong>'She reminded me of God's grace'</strong></h2><p>Rebecca's loved ones paid tribute to her on social media. "I still can’t believe your gone," wrote Mattie Tjaden, who appears to be someone who was very close to Rebecca. "I remember the smiles, the happiness of this woman even when super stressed and frustrated still somehow brought a smile to your face. The woman who held me when I was wailing in pain, sadness and failing feeling from losing my baby j, my first angel. Who reminded me of Gods grace in at a time when I needed it most. Who would continue to follow up on me and my baby K and now daughter. Who would offer a moment of encouragement or hug when needed. I hope heaven realises how much of an amazing kind person they have received. My thoughts are with your boys and hope they find comfort in how much kindness and impression you have left on this earth."</p><p>"Friends, please pray for Becky and her family. If you were blessed to have her as a friend, you know what a beautiful angel she is. Becky had the warmest heart and a genuine compassion for others. Her smile, her eyes, her distinct and contagious laugh will forever be in our hearts," wrote Megan Lovelace. "So many prayers needed and especially for her sweet boys. Becky ‘has’ the most admirable love for her children. My memories of Becky’s friendship and love will forever be cherished."</p><p>"I can’t say I knew her long-or well for that matter-but I do know what a wonderful coworker, advocate, friend and momma she was. Please pray that justice will be served for this special soul," said Christina Schlaf Frost.</p><p>"I hope you know you made a difference. Rest in paradise, while another said, "This is absolutely heartbreaking and a senseless tragedy. Rest in peace Becky".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq5iaerOxzKKlnZ2UYrqmec6fZKCnlKh6qL7AnJxmpJ%2BrsqV5zqecrGWimrqmucGeqWarnJa2r3nMqKRmqpWXsqSvwGaZpaGVm7uqr8pmmKGdkZl6sLKMn6ynnaKWuQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshe-reminded-me-of-gods-grace-loved-ones-remember-slain-mom-rebecca-bliefnick-ahead-of-funeral.html&text=The%20Murder%20of%20Rebecca%20Bliefnick%3a%20Family%20and%20friends%20pay%20tribute%20to%20%27God%27s%20grace%27%20ahead%20of%20funeral&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshe-reminded-me-of-gods-grace-loved-ones-remember-slain-mom-rebecca-bliefnick-ahead-of-funeral.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshe-reminded-me-of-gods-grace-loved-ones-remember-slain-mom-rebecca-bliefnick-ahead-of-funeral.html&title=The%20Murder%20of%20Rebecca%20Bliefnick%3a%20Family%20and%20friends%20pay%20tribute%20to%20%27God%27s%20grace%27%20ahead%20of%20funeral" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshe-reminded-me-of-gods-grace-loved-ones-remember-slain-mom-rebecca-bliefnick-ahead-of-funeral.html&title=The%20Murder%20of%20Rebecca%20Bliefnick%3a%20Family%20and%20friends%20pay%20tribute%20to%20%27God%27s%20grace%27%20ahead%20of%20funeral" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshe-reminded-me-of-gods-grace-loved-ones-remember-slain-mom-rebecca-bliefnick-ahead-of-funeral.html&title=The%20Murder%20of%20Rebecca%20Bliefnick%3a%20Family%20and%20friends%20pay%20tribute%20to%20%27God%27s%20grace%27%20ahead%20of%20funeral" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshe-reminded-me-of-gods-grace-loved-ones-remember-slain-mom-rebecca-bliefnick-ahead-of-funeral.html&description=The%20Murder%20of%20Rebecca%20Bliefnick%3a%20Family%20and%20friends%20pay%20tribute%20to%20%27God%27s%20grace%27%20ahead%20of%20funeral" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./zazie-beetz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth Behind the Actress Zazie Beetz Multicultural Background, Her Parents">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-guardian-australia-editor-lenore-taylor-and-her-husband-journalist-paul-daley-love-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Guardian Australia Editor Lenore Taylor And Her Husband Journalist Paul Daley Love Story The Tal">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
