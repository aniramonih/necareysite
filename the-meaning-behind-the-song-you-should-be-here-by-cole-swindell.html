The chorus is the most emotional part of the song and is meant to convey the desire to be with someone who is no longer here. The lyrics say:</p><p>“‘Cause there’s a bigger picture That I’m looking at, on my own And missing you comes in waves And tonight I’m drowning”</p><p>The lyrics of the song are very relatable because everyone has lost someone they love at some point in their lives.
