She&nbsp;was born and named Aryeh Judah Schoen Nusbacher in New York City on the 17th of December 1966. The historian was born a male child to her parents and he grew up in the city with them until he had to move to Toronto for studies.</p><p>There are no details about her childhood and it is not known whether or not she has other siblings. Although some people think that Jonas Maines is her brother, Jonas is actually the twin brother of Nicole Maines, an actress and trans activist. Also, Wayne Mainse and Kelly Mainse who are often regarded as her parents are parents of Jonas and Nicole.</p><h2><strong>What is Lynette Nusbacher’s Gender?</strong></h2><p>The military historian was born a man and his sexuality was straight. However, in 2007, at age forty-one, he decided to go for a transition to become a woman. Nobody knows what inspired her decision, and she has not made any public statement about it. Before the transition, Lynette was married and after she became a woman, she received all the emotional support she needed from her spouse and family.</p><p>Moreso, the intellectual became a source of motivation for people who were not comfortable with who they were. Being a person of great influence, and still going on to do what she really wanted, her decision started different conversations in the USA and UK. Conversations were raised regarding gender identity and transphobia, especially in academia. She is one of the most popular transgender women in Europe and her decision is considered an act of bravery especially because she is a public figure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/dr-lynette-nusbacher-before.jpg><h2><strong>Who is Lynette Nusbacher’s Partner?</strong></h2><p>Lynette was married to Melanie Bright for twelve years. Melanie is a marketing communications expert with over twenty years of experience in her field. She has quite an interesting professional background, working with different institutions and she is obviously successful at her career just like her ex-partner.</p><p>Nusbacher and Bright met at Royal Military College and dated for a year before getting married. They were happily married until 2010, three years after Nusbacher’s gender reassignment. The former couple went their separate ways without revealing what the cause of the divorce was. However, it is safe to assume that the historian’s decision to transition from one gender to another may have contributed greatly if not solely to it.</p><h2><strong>Lynette Nusbacher’s Son/Children</strong></h2><p>While Lynette Nusbacher and Melanie Bright were married, they were blessed with two daughters and one son. However, the former couple has chosen to keep their kids off the media and as such, there is no information about them. Melanie Bright is reported to have gone with the kids after their divorce.</p><h3><strong>She is Now a Specialist in Economics, History and War Studies</strong></h3><p>The American historian is well-read and has an impressive educational background. She started her academic journey around 1984, by moving to Canada to become a History and Economics major at the University of Toronto. After obtaining a BA degree, she was employed as the University’s administrator.</p><p>In 1994, she left to obtain a master’s degree in War Studies from the Royal Military College of Canada. Although the course was offered at the University of Toronto, she chose to abandon her job and try somewhere new. With her knowledge from war studies, she was able to work with decision-makers and war consultancy firms. But, Dr. Nusbacher was intrigued more by world history and after two years at the Royal Military College of Canada, she decided to go for a Ph.D. program in Modern History at the University of Oxford.</p><p>Nusbacher’s insatiable thirst for knowledge led her to enroll in different education programs despite having a Ph.D. already. She attended the British National School of Government where she studied a Leadership course in 2009. Again, she enrolled in a Defense Strategic Leadership program at Cranfield University.</p><p>Summary of Schools where Dr. Lynette Nusbacher Studied and Qualifications She Earned</p><ul><li>University of Toronto – BA History and Economics</li><li>Royal Military College of Canada – MA War Studies</li><li>University of Oxford – Ph.D. Modern History</li><li>British National School of Government – Leadership Course</li><li>Cranfield University – Defense Strategic Leadership Program</li></ul><h2><strong>Dr. Lynette Nusbacher</strong><strong>&nbsp;Has Worked In Different Capacities Over The Years</strong></h2><h3><strong>Administrator At The University of Toronto (1988 – 1994)</strong></h3><p>Dr. Lynette Nusbacher had her first job between 1988 and 1994 as an administrator at the University of Toronto.

Here, she had the responsibility of planning and overseeing the general logistics. She was good at her job and she got promoted to a division staff officer in 2000.</p><h3><strong>Military Historian at Time Commanders (2003 – 2005)</strong></h3><p>Later in 2003, the intelligent lady started working in the “Time Commanders” show at BBC. From 2003 to 2005 when she stopped working there, the world of military politics was facing a redefining period. As an expert, she helped to educate the viewers on military intermediations, especially on Iraq’s war situation.</p><h3><strong>Consultant at LMC (2006 – 2017)</strong></h3><p>Nusbacher worked as the principal consultant at LMC from 2006 to 2017. While she was there, she did a lot in operational research. Also, she contributed to war studies on the global scene.</p><h3><strong>Senior Intelligence Advisor to the UK Cabinet (2007)</strong></h3><p>While she was still with LMC, in 2007, she got an offer to serve as an intelligence advisor at the UK cabinet. With her past experience in security systems, she came up with policies that resulted in a clean system in the UK. She was one of the people that developed the national-level security assessment guideline that is functional to date.</p><h3><strong>Dr. Lynette Nusbacher is also a Lecturer</strong></h3><p>Aside from her office jobs, Dr. Lynette Nusbacher has also worked as a lecturer in different colleges.

One of her most-read publications is “Battle of Bannockburn 1314, and War and Conflict”. Through this book, she became one of the most cited intellectuals in European military development in the Middle Ages. She has another book titled “War of Conflict” which targets young people. Also, the author is a contributor at “Time of Israel”, an online publication on war and politics.</p><h3><strong>Panelist at History Channel and BBC</strong></h3><p>Prior to her gender transition, Nusbacher appeared on different History Channel and BBC discussions as a panelist. She gave her views on war and politics and showed viewers a different perspective of international conflicts. Most of her predictions about war and conflict resolution came to pass.</p><h3><strong>Founder of Nusbacher Associates</strong></h3><p>Another thing Dr. Lynette Nusbacher loves apart from military and history is cyber tech and general technology. To this effect, she owns an online platform, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Nusbacher Associates</a>, where talks about contemporary problems and how tech influences policymakers.</p><p>With her many years of experience and contribution to the sector of military affairs and history, Dr. Lynette has made a great impact in the niche. The nation still benefits from some of her early works.
