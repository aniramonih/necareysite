Throughout his senior and junior years at OSU, Brad got the opportunity to chase storms together with his fellow students and also professors during the Spring quarter.</p><p>After graduating from OSU, he got his first job in Dayton, Ohio at the NBC station doing the morning shift. After some time Brad was offered a unique opportunity by a FOX affiliate station. He was asked to start a whole weather department from the ground up and he was to be their first chief meteorologist in Traverse City. Almost 15 months later, Brad was attending a weather conference and was offered an opportunity to work in New Orleans. He moved to work for WWL-TV as the weekend meteorologist. While there Brad chased Hurricanes and rainstorms that frequently flooded the city for three years.</p><p>In the year 2005, he went back to his old station to help out before a hurricane struck the Gulf Coast. As a result, he ended up being amid of the worst Hurricanes in U.S. history called Hurricane Katrina. Brad rode the storm out in a confined conference hall that was attached to the Super dome and spent two nights in the city before he went to Baton Rouge where he spent 15 days working for WWL. He later went back after a week to work again as Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf Coast and spent 2 more weeks.</p><p>He is now glad to be working at WCNC as part of the First Warn Storm team as a chief meteorologist.

The moms helped out in buying Brad gift cards for dinner after they discovered that he was working during his breaks to cover Florence for days.</p><p>After some time, the moms had too much money and decided to obtain supplies for Florence’s victims. Then followed a post that was suggesting a t-shirt fundraiser and the pre-orders started turning up. 100% of the earnings from the sale of the t-shirts branded “I’m a Brad FANovich” would go directly to hurricane relief efforts.</p><h2>Brad Panovich Salary</h2><p>He makes quite an impressive amount from working at WCNC Charlotte as a chief meteorologist.
