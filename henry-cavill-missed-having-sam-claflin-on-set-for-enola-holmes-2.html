Judge fouled off four and did not put any balls in play.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Boone said Judge took at-bats Tuesday in Florida, played the field for ‘five innings or so’ and ‘ran the bases a little bit.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Hopefully more of the same and maybe a little more volume tomorrow,’ Boone said at Yankee Stadium before his team’s Subway Series opener against the New York Mets, which they lost 9-3.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Right now it’s just, down there we’re seeing how this goes and seeing if we can kind of script things and make sure he’s getting a lot of at-bats.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Judge has acknowledged he won’t be pain-free when he returns, but the Yankees think he’ll be able to play right field rather than just serve as a designated hitter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He just started taking live at-bats. So yeah, we’ll do whatever we have to do,’ Boone said. ‘But he’s got to build up from kind of a workload standpoint of, you don’t just go from taking batting practice or lifting weights or working out to going out and playing nine innings, whether it’s DH or right field. But hoping and feeling that right field will be in play. So this is all just part of kind of building him up a little better.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Boone said Loáisiga was heading to Tampa on Tuesday night and would participate in the simulated game situations Wednesday with Judge.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In another injury update, Nestor Cortes (strained left rotator cuff) is scheduled to make his second minor league rehab start Friday, though Boone wasn’t sure where yet. Cortes allowed one run and four hits Sunday while throwing 42 pitches over 2 1/3 innings for Double-A Somerset.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Second baseman Gleyber Torres was in the starting lineup against the Mets after leaving Sunday’s victory over Kansas City in the seventh inning because of left hip tightness. Torres hit a two-run homer Sunday and extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13 games.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>New York began the day 53-47 and tied with rival Boston for last place in the AL East. Both teams were 2 1/2 games out of a playoff spot.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Yankees entered Tuesday 18-22 since Judge got hurt in Los Angeles. Last month, he received two injections before progressing to playing catch and taking light swings.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Judge set an American League record with 62 home runs last year. He is batting .291 with 19 homers and 40 RBIs in the first season of a $360 million, nine-year contract he signed last offseason.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>New York is 30-19 with Judge, who also missed 10 games earlier this season with a right hip strain sustained when he tried to steal third base in Minnesota on his 31st birthday April 26.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cLTEp6myZZOWw6q4y2akoqujmrFutMCvoKefXaiurnnCpZifpJmjerC6jKycrWWWpL9usc2oo5plmKS5rrHSZmlo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhenry-cavill-missed-having-sam-claflin-on-set-for-enola-holmes-2.html&text=Aaron%20Judge%20%27is%20set%20to%20return%20for%20the%20Yankees%20on%20FRIDAY%27%20against%20Baltimore%20Orioles...%20having%20been%20ou&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhenry-cavill-missed-having-sam-claflin-on-set-for-enola-holmes-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhenry-cavill-missed-having-sam-claflin-on-set-for-enola-holmes-2.html&title=Aaron%20Judge%20%27is%20set%20to%20return%20for%20the%20Yankees%20on%20FRIDAY%27%20against%20Baltimore%20Orioles...%20having%20been%20ou" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhenry-cavill-missed-having-sam-claflin-on-set-for-enola-holmes-2.html&title=Aaron%20Judge%20%27is%20set%20to%20return%20for%20the%20Yankees%20on%20FRIDAY%27%20against%20Baltimore%20Orioles...%20having%20been%20ou" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhenry-cavill-missed-having-sam-claflin-on-set-for-enola-holmes-2.html&title=Aaron%20Judge%20%27is%20set%20to%20return%20for%20the%20Yankees%20on%20FRIDAY%27%20against%20Baltimore%20Orioles...%20having%20been%20ou" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhenry-cavill-missed-having-sam-claflin-on-set-for-enola-holmes-2.html&description=Aaron%20Judge%20%27is%20set%20to%20return%20for%20the%20Yankees%20on%20FRIDAY%27%20against%20Baltimore%20Orioles...%20having%20been%20ou" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./20060803406395.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adrien and Pen's movie gets its own tourist trail">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./21-november-indian-celebrity-birthdays-famous-people-birthdays-indian-celebrity-november-21-305067.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="21 November Indian Celebrity Birthdays: Famous People Birthdays Indian Celebrity November 21">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
